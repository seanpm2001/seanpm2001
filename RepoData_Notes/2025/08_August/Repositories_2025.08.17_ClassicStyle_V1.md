No projects

Starting 2025, Sunday, July 27th, I no longer intend to create source repositories on Saturday or Sunday, so that I can have time for other projects, with the exception of Saturday being a catch-up day for Friday, should scheduled Friday work not be completed that week. I should have started on 2025, Saturday, July 26th, but I didn't think ahead on it, and scheduled projects before considering the change.

- I had a mid length session today. My session started in the late morning. The game did not require an update this week.

- A new Sonar Ops game mode was introduced, but I did not play in this mode.
- Ads worked fine this week, and there weren't any connection issues.
- I went after Dr. Terror threat 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 today, not losing any troops on any stages.
- I continued power stone conversion again this week. I am planning on building magma masterpiece statues to increase troop health (current boost: 25%)
- I fixed the connection issues sixty-three weeks ago by switching to a Wi-Fi hotspot. I still feel there is some blame for SUPERCELL servers being so inefficient. The connection issue briefly came back on 2024, September 1st, but was not present on 2024, September 8th, and there were some issues on 2024, September 15th. There were severe issues on 2025, February 23rd.
- I traded some terror tokens for some more wood, so that I could upgrade my Proto Troop Workshop to level 5. I also upgraded my mega scorcher troop to level 6.
- I remembered to collect treasure chests from the map this week to earn diamonds.
- I toured 1 base this week, but did not attack it.
- I did a submarine dive. Afterwards, I quit. I had a decent time playing. This was my thirty-third session of the year, and my third session of 2025, August. - 2025, Sunday, August 17th
