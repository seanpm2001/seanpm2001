# Repository description data 2025, Monday, November 24th

---

## No projects

Today was a really hard day for me, as I didn't get enough sleep last night, and the sleep I did get wasn't quality sleep. It caused mental health issues for the entire day. I have had to cut back significantly to reduce suffering, and make it through the rest of the day. As such, no new repositories were created today. I will create the 5 scheduled repositories from today, tomorrow, alongside an additional 5.

Projects temporarily skipped:

- Learn-Boomerang
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_Boomerang
- Polyworks-SquareOff_Website
- PetLand-Software_Website
- Oh_Hi_MarkDown_Website
