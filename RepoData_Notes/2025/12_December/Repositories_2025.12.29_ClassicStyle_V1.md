No projects (plan to return tomorrow)

I have been going through a lot, and am struggling greatly to get caught up. To ease stress on myself, I moved this weeks work to 2026, September (the next available opening) and skipped all new projects for this week, in order to try and get caught up again, and to stay caught up.

I was going to return today, but I just wasn't ready yet. I had to compromise on 2 private projects, by making a write-off (counting all goals from 2025, December 14th to today as not needed, and continuing with December 14th notes upon resuming, instead of working with notes for every one of these days (which would have required over 20 hours of constant work)) I plan to return tomorrow with new projects, and plan to resume work on these 2 major private projects on 2026, January 1st.

Here are the projects I didn't get to today:

- Learn-Little-Implementation-Language-_LIL_
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_Little-Implementation-Language-_LIL_
- MemeMachine-2019_Website
- JScribe_Website
- UltraSwitch_Website

These will be done tomorrow, along with 5 more. I have been making progress on getting caught back up today, although not as much as hoped.
