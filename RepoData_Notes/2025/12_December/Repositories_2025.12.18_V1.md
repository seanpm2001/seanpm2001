## No projects

I had a hardware failure earlier this month (the touchpad on my old laptop went out) using the USB mouse was too frustrating, so I rushed my process of moving over to my next laptop (which I have been doing backups and testing on for about a month now) I have been working a lot slower since, as my new programs are not what I am used to (Kate and GNOME Text Editor, instead of KDE, along with difficulties regarding GNOME 46) and I am losiug a lot of time. I had to significantly cut work. Time is very strained, and focus issues make this worse. I was not successful in staying caught up today, as something went wrong again. Here are the projects I didn't get to create today:

- Learn-Jess
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_Jess
- NimbleByte_Website
- TrueEEG_Website
- UShortcut_Pro_Website

These should be created tomorrow, unless something goes wrong again.
