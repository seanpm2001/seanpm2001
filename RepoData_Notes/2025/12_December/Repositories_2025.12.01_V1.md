# Repository description data 2025, Monday, December 1st

## No projects

I had a hard time productively tonight, losing a couple of hours to procrastination, which was made worse by an extended push on another project. It may take me multiple days to recover from this, due to how strict and tight my schedule is. Due to this, new repository work was skipped today, and is being held off for tomorrow, where I will face 10 entries, instead of 5. Here are the entries that I skipped today:

- Learn-COMAL
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_COMAL
- HyperSlice_Website
- 3FakeIM_Website
- WYII_Website
