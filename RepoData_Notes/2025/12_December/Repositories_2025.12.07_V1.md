# Repository description data 2025, Sunday, December 7th

---

## No projects

On 2025, July 11th, I discovered the GitHub 100,000 repository limit, after coming near 50,000 repositories. To continue GitHUb usage normally for the long-term, I had to stop forking repositories.

Starting 2025, Sunday, July 27th, I no longer intend to create source repositories on Saturday or Sunday, so that I can have time for other projects, with the exception of Saturday being a catch-up day for Friday, should scheduled Friday work not be completed that week. I should have started on 2025, Saturday, July 26th, but I didn't think ahead on it, and scheduled projects before considering the change.
