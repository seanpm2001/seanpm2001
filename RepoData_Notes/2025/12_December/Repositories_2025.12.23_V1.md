## No projects

I have been going through a lot, and am struggling greatly to get caught up. To ease stress on myself, I moved this weeks work to 2026, September (the next available opening) and skipped all new projects for this week, in order to try and get caught up again, and to stay caught up. I do not plan to return until 2025, Monday, December 29th.
