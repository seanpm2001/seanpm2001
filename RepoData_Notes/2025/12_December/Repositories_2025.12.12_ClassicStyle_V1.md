No projects

I had a hardware failure 5 nights ago (the touchpad on my old laptop went out) using the USB mouse was too frustrating, so I rushed my process of moving over to my next laptop (which I have been doing backups and testing on for about a month now) I have been working a lot slower since, as my new programs are not what I am used to (Kate and GNOME Text Editor, instead of KDE, along with difficulties regarding GNOME 46) and I am losing a lot of time. I had to significantly cut work, and even took time off from my journal today to try and get caught back up. I was not successful. Here are the projects I didn't get to create today:

- Learn-GEORGE
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_GEORGE
- Team8_Collection_Website
- CrossCompatXU_Website
- CH3-c-K_Website

These should be created tomorrow, unless something goes wrong again. I did not even have the time to write RepoData notes today.
