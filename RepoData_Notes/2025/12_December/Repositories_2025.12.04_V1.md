## No projects

My schedule is currently a chromatic see-saw (chronos = time) I spent a couple days on GitHub getting caught back up on some projects, but fell behind on my journal, so extra time was spent on that today, which threw me back here (if the see-saw pattern continues, I will be behind on my journal again in 2 days, and the process will repeat) I am now falling behind here again, and hadf to skip a lot today.

Here are the projects I had to skip today

- Learn-CEEMAC
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_CEEMAC
- MarkDownDownDown_Website
- KeyStroke_Website
- Perl_Harbor_Website

There were several other projects that I couldn't work on, due to a lack of time. I hope to get back to this tomorrow.
