I had a hardware failure last night (the touchpad on my old laptop went out) using the USB mouse was too frustrating, so I rushed my process of moving over to my next laptop (which I have been doing backups and testing on for about a month now) this required a lot of time today, and pushed work later into the day, which later caused panic. A lot of work was skipped today because of it. The following planned repositories were not created today:

- Learn-Z-level-programming-language
- SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_Z-level-programming-language
- VOI-Manor_Website
- Stock-Elevator-LIBrary_Website
- ChargeFX_Website

These should be created tomorrow, unless something goes wrong again.
