# Repository description data 2025, Saturday, December 27th

---

## No projects

On 2025, July 11th, I discovered the GitHub 100,000 repository limit, after coming near 50,000 repositories. To continue GitHUb usage normally for the long-term, I had to stop forking repositories.

Starting 2025, Sunday, July 27th, I no longer intend to create source repositories on Saturday or Sunday, so that I can have time for other projects, with the exception of Saturday being a catch-up day for Friday, should scheduled Friday work not be completed that week. I should have started on 2025, Saturday, July 26th, but I didn't think ahead on it, and scheduled projects before considering the change.

Additionally, I have been going through a lot, and am struggling greatly to get caught up. To ease stress on myself, I moved this weeks work to 2026, September (the next available opening) and skipped all new projects for this week, in order to try and get caught up again, and to stay caught up. I do not plan to return until 2025, Monday, December 29th.
