No projects (vacation)

I was on vacation today, and purposefully did not start any new repositories, so that I could have more time at the beach. I won't resume new projects until 2025, Tuesday, September 2nd. Today was the last day of my vacation.

Starting 2025, Sunday, July 27th, I no longer intend to create source repositories on Saturday or Sunday, so that I can have time for other projects, with the exception of Saturday being a catch-up day for Friday, should scheduled Friday work not be completed that week. I should have started on 2025, Saturday, July 26th, but I didn't think ahead on it, and scheduled projects before considering the change.
