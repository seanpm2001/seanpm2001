# Repository description data 2025, Saturday, June 7th

---

SKIPPED:

I am on a reduced workload from 2025, Friday, June 6th to 2025, Saturday, June 7th. No new source repositories will be created in this time.

I was supposed to be leaving town during this time, but I ended up not going, due to logistical issues. I am still doing other work, and now have the opportunity to catch up on some projects. I will return to new projects tomorrow.
