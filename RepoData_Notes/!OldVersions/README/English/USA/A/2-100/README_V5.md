These are notes regarding repository setup information, specifically the title of new repositories, and their description. Consistently writing this down and saving it to a separate file is a newer process for me that has become completely standard by early 2023. This directory houses my RepoData notes.

## Private projects and redaction

I have some private projects as of writing this. The following entries have been redacted:

- 2023, June 24th (2 out of 6 entries redacted)
- 2023, August 11th (2 out of 6 entries redacted)
- 2023, August 14th (2 out of 6 entries redacted)

[`Original redaction notes`](/RepoData_Notes/Before-you-upload_REDACTION_2023.08.17.patch)

Several more entries have now been redacted, there are too many for me to list here right now. To find them, look through entries with the string `_REDACTED` in their name.

The files are still there, and contain other entries, but 6 repositories had to be redacted. When these projects become public in the future, I will upload the original notes, and keep the redacted copies as well.

For further information on redaction, and how to unredact entries, see here [:octocat: `seanpm2001/Redacted`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Redacted/)

## Other information

I have been planning on uploading this data for about a week now (as of 2023, Thursday, August 17th) and on this day, I decided to go ahead and upload it.

Starting on 2023, Wednesday, October 11th, each day now has a new variant known as `classic_style` it is the same as the original notes, except it doesn't feature the new header and footer that is now the default for the notes. I will continue to produce a new style and classic style variant for each day of notes.

There was a lot of downtime between new projects in various points in the set. This isn't because notes weren't created (at least for 2022 November onward, before this, the process was not consistent) but because no new source repositories were created on this day.
