These are notes regarding repository setup information, specifically the title of new repositories, and their description. Consistently writing this down and saving it to a separate file is a newer process for me that has become completely standard by early 2023. This directory houses my RepoData notes.

I have some private projects as of writing this. The following entries have been redacted:

- 2023, June 24th (2 out of 6 entries redacted)
- 2023, August 11th (2 out of 6 entries redacted)
- 2023, August 14th (2 out of 6 entries redacted)

[`Original redaction notes`](/RepoData_Notes/Before-you-upload_REDACTION_2023.08.17.patch)

The files are still there, and contain other entries, but 6 repositories had to be redacted. When these projects become public in the future, I will upload the original notes, and keep the redacted copies as well.

I have been planning on uploading this data for about a week now (as of 2023, Thursday, August 17th) and on this day, I decided to go ahead and upload it.
