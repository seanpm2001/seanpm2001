// I chose Java as the 17th project language file for this project (seanpm2001/seanpm2001) as it is a language I have history with, it is the second programming language I took an in-person class on, and I want to keep it up at the top. A project language file in my core repository can indicate this. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
