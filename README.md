Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, over 25 translations are out of date and are using Version 8 or Version 9 of this README file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 1st 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

üéåÔ∏è **Flag guide** üéåÔ∏è

üö©Ô∏èüè¥Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è Flags were beginning to get added in version 2 of this document. I was originally just going to add the Ukraine üá∫üá¶Ô∏è flag, but decided to add more, until every language had at least 1 flag. They were done purely with the existing knowledge of the developer. In version 3, flags were added for every language. There are some notes that go with this:

üåêÔ∏è **[Unions `üá™üá∫Ô∏è` and Nations `üá∫üá≥Ô∏è`]** üåêÔ∏è

Languages listed here that are official languages of the European Union have a European Union flag `üá™üá∫Ô∏è` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 27 languages recognized by the European Union, from 27 different member states.

Languages listed here that are official languages of the United Nations have a United Nations flag `üá∫üá≥Ô∏è` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 6 languages recognized by the European Union (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish) alongside 193 different member states and 2 observer states.

üåèÔ∏è **[One China (PRC) `üá®üá≥Ô∏è` Two China (Taiwan) `üáπüáºÔ∏è` Hong Kong `üá≠üá∞Ô∏è` and Macau `üá≤üá¥Ô∏è`]** üåèÔ∏è

For neutrality reasons, languages listed here that have an official majority in Chinese speakers will receive all 4 of these flags, even if the language isn't Chinese or in the Sino family of languages.

üåêÔ∏è **[Global languages `üåêÔ∏è`]** üåêÔ∏è

Currently, 1 global language is listed, and that is Esperanto. Esperanto is not native to any countries, its goal is to be a universal _lingua franca_ (Latin translation: _bridge language_) it is represented with a `globe with meridians` or `üåêÔ∏è`

üíûÔ∏è **[Regarding sexuality üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàÔ∏è]** üíûÔ∏è

Sexuality is not measured here, I feel it would be unnecessary, as you are picking out a language, not a sexuality.

üí†Ô∏è **[Location of flag üö©Ô∏è]** üí†Ô∏è

Flags are located at the end of each language name (after the Romanization) with one space before, to the right.

Like this:

**[Pl Polski Polish üáµüá±Ô∏è]**

But not like this:

**[Pl Polski üáµüá±Ô∏è Polish]**

And also not like this:

**[Pl üáµüá±Ô∏è Polski Polish]**

I was so angry and frustrated. I didn't save the file, and my computer randomly froze up twice, then crashed. I had to re-add all the flags, it took an hour to do so originally, and I was just seconds away from finishing. I couldn't save the file quick enough. Luckily, all the research was still in my head, and there was no data that wasn't easily replacable (identically) so it is a type of important work that was the best thing to lose, since it was the easiest to recreate, taking me less than 20 minutes

**Other notes:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è A language is missing: `Latvian`
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Possibly supporting the next 126 languages that are going to be added to Google Translate
- üóúÔ∏è Plans to automate this process with the [`@AUTOMATE2001`](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001) bot
- ‚õîÔ∏è Need to find a way to work with these languages on services other than Google Translate.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è There might be noticeable lag in this section due to how many flag emojis are in use.

**Languages segment version:** `4 (2022, Monday, March 14th at 1:59 pm)`

[`Wikipedia summary`](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine&oldid=1215221241&useskin=monobook)

> On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II. It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory. From a population of 41 million in January 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war, widely described as an ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

It isn't exact, I have many interests. What I am always learning include:

- World history
- Computer Programming and computer history
- The languages of the world (linguistics)
- Virtualization
- Solutions to major world problems
- Pre-history
- Psychology
- Current world problems
- Other (non-culinary)

### [üöÄÔ∏è What I'm looking to collaborate on](#-What-I-m-looking-to-collaborate-on)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I currently need a technical job. I am willing to work on any ethical computer project, as long as it is written in a language I know well (Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, CSS, Lisp, Markdown, XML, Shell, or any/all of the ones listed)

<details><summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse further collaboration info]</summary>

***

Companies I refuse to work for include:

> Google

> Facebook

> Zoom technologies

> Spectrum Enterprise

> Clever

> No other companies currently listed

Companies I am currently considering include:

> Microsoft [::] - I have some family that works here, and I have had a long past with Microsoft (all the way back to 2005) even though I consider some things Microsoft does as unethical, I wouldn't mind working here (I have a very strong personal experience with Microsoft products, notably Windows XP) If there are any jobs here that use Python, I can do them.

> VideoLan /-\ - I would like to try and write documentation for VideoLan, I am very good at writing documentation, as I enjoy doing it, and I do it most of the day, every day. Currently, VideoLan is unable to have documentation writers due to low amounts of volunteers. If allowed, I will write documentation for every version of VLC that doesn't have it (only in English, I can't do other languages)

> Canonical (&) - I would like to try and contribute to Linux in any way I can. Working at Canonical is currently an option, I don't know exactly what I would do here, but I could hopefully do something.

> The KDE Foundation (K) - KDE would be a nice foundation to work for. I really love their super lightweight open source projects, and I could help reduce even more bloat. If a job is available in a language I have at least 40% knowledge in, I could work here.

> Khan Academy (^) - I would like to help contribute to Khan Academy, I have used the site for nearly 4 years straight on a daily basis. If it would be possible to make videos and articles for them, I have always considered starting a course on virtualization.

> The GNOME organization (G) - if possible, I could try and set some changes to reduce the huge memory usage of GNOME, that has always stuck out as something that needs to be fixed to me. It is still a lot better than Windows 10s memory usage, idle on Windows 10 would use half my RAM, no matter how much I had (4, 8, 16 GB) on my first Linux laptop, it has always stayed below 1.8 gigabytes when idle (also counting the system monitor)

> No other companies currently listed

### [üëÄÔ∏è What I'm looking to help with](#-What-I-m-looking-to-help-with)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I will do free technical support for you, or programming related work in my scope of knowledge. I do this on my own time, so I can only help a certain amount of people a day. Before trying to ask for my technical support, try the following to troubleshoot:

> `CTRL` + `Z` - Undoes your last mistake

> Restart your computer

I charge money for technical support ($5.00 per hour) if I have to do these steps more than 3 times in a year for 1 person.

**Some limitations**

I cannot do projects unless the scripts are on GitHub or SourceForge already.

I also can't work on projects that are related to your school work. Please do not ask me to do your school work for you. We could both get in trouble for this.

I would prefer to help with projects written in Python 3, Markdown, HTML5, CSS3, Java, C, C++, or JavaScript. I won't be able to help as well with projects written in other languages.

No other limitations listed at the moment.

I am a intermediate photographer, and can take really good pictures without the need of manipulating the original image to make it better (other than the times I accidentally get my thumb in the shot) I can take photos for you when needed. My current camera is 4K (2160p, or 2K) 60 frames per second.

I am an entry-level graphic designer with a large preference for skeumorphism and 3D design with gradients and patterns. I have taken a few graphic design classes and can create computer graphics using GIMP, MS-PAINT, Blender 2.79, InkScape, Adobe PhotoShop CS6, 2015, CC 2017, Adobe Animate CS6, 2015, CC 2017, Adobe InDesign CC 2017, Adobe Illustrator CC 2017, BYOB 1.x, and Scratch 2.

I have been a linguist since my early childhood. I jokingly changed my middle name to `language` in my early childhood, but I think it would fit as a 2nd middle name.

I like the look and sound of various languages, whether they are human spoken or machine instructions. Unfortunately, I can't write completely in a language other than English, Python, HTML, or markdown.

I like to learn about history, and I have knowledge of a large assortment of eras and events, including extensive knowledge of things other than World War I or World War II (but I also still know a lot about the 2 world wars) for Earth history, my knowledge goes back to 8000 BCE in extensive detail, down to 27000 BCE in less detail, and mostly geological events before 27000 BCE. I like to learn all types of history, and not just the history of warfare.

I owe my interest in history to my first High School history teacher, who was really enthusiastic about what he was teaching, and was just a general awesome and nice history teacher. I would no doubt make him teacher of the year for that year of High School. Past history classes never got me too into the subject of history, but this one really opened my mind to history.

**My areas of research:**

Pretty much anything, but mainly:

- Europe
- World War I
- World War II
- American Revolutionary War
- American Civil War
- Napoleonic Wars
- Ukraine
- Russia
- Belarus
- Poland
- Korea (both North and South)

I keep a daily journal. I have been on and off with this for most of my childhood, until sticking with it every day since September 26th 2016.

The journaling project is part of my life archive project, a digital archive of my entire life.

As of August 7th 2021, the main journal has over 7 million words. I average between 1358-2500/2500-3600/3600-13000 words per day (depending on what happens that day and how much I have to talk about)

I plan to publish the full journal on Tuesday, May 15th 2040. For now, certain related media, and certain templates are public, but several terabytes of data is private (the full journal takes up over 8 gigabytes of space, just for the journal, due to usage of images over a ~5 year period)

## [üêßÔ∏è Linux](#-Linux)

<details><summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse my Linux story]</summary>

I was a fan of Windows up until Windows 10. I began to try to switch to Linux from 2018 to 2020. On July 9th 2020, I finally switched to Linux, getting my first Dell laptop with Linux pre-installed.

![20200709_124359.jpg](/Media/20200709_124359.jpg)

My first full on Linux operating system (other than Android 1.6) is Ubuntu 20.04. I am a very proud Linux user, as I am no longer constrained my forced updates, proprietary software and licensing, lack of control and customization, the fear of instability, and other issues I had with Windows 10. As of March 4th 2021, I am still using Linux on a daily basis, but my fear of Blue Screens has not gone away, sometimes even fearing I got a blue screen when I know that isn't even technically possible on Ubuntu (unless you had software that mimicks it) I originally was going to install Fedora 32 on my laptop when I got it, but I decided to give Ubuntu a try first. So far, I have liked it, except for 2 things: Snaps being proprietary, and the ugliness of GNOME 3.x (compared to earlier versions and other desktop environments, like the one I wanted but haven't installed yet; KDE)

## [üõéÔ∏è How to reach me](#-How-to-reach-me)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted (in early 2022, I also destroyed the SIM/SD slot in my phone due to overuse, so there is no way to fix this now) Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)
* Through Discord (`Seanpm2001-GitHub` server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

**Discord user links:**

> * `SeanWallaWalla#1709` (my original Discord account)
> * `seanpm2001#4906` (my newest Discord account)

**Context:**

![Discord_2022.06.21_seanpm_seanpm2001.png](/Media/Discord_Screenshots/2022/June21st/Discord_2022.06.21_seanpm_seanpm2001.png)

On 2022, June 21st, someone joined my Discord server with a username incredibly similar to my own. I had to claim the `seanpm2001` username to prevent an imposter from forming.

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/) - currently inactive on the subreddit, but I will likely respond to a reply or DM within 48 hours

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me

## [ü™ßÔ∏è Projects on other platforms](#-Projects-on-other-platforms)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have been using GitHub for software development since May 25th 2020, but I have been programming since early 2016.

On December 21st 2020, I created accounts on SourceForge, GitLab, and BitBucket. I currently don't maintain any projects there at the moment, GitHub still is the powerhouse.

- [SourceForge link](https://sourceforge.net/u/seanpm2001/profile/)
- [GitLab link](https://gitlab.com/seanpm2001/)
- [BitBucket link](https://bitbucket.org/seanpm2001/)

When I joined GitHub, I also intended to use other platforms as well, as something could always go wrong with my account or GitHub itself, and it isn't smart to rely on a single source for everything.

Now, if GitHub is having problems or if you have problems with GitHub, my projects are viewable on 3 other platforms. Unfortunately, they are still only on GitHub, as I don't have enough developers to manage 4 platforms at once, I will eventually mirror my projects over.

## [üìßÔ∏è Email information](#-Email-information)

On 2022 Friday, January 7th, I created my first public email address. I may not be active here, but I will try to be here. The email address will be used for a mailing list.

The current public email address is [seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com](mailto:seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)

The email address is for professional use, and is tied to my GitHub developer program membership. It is to be used for serious inqueries and security reports. It is NOT to be used for conversation, advertising, notifications, or spam. If you wish to chat, I have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ) here, and I plan to have a more privacy friendly platform for communication in the near future.

Note: this email address is NOT a mailing list, it is just named like that. The name was inspired by the Linux Kernel Mailing List.

However, I am not on other platforms. If you see someone posing on me on other platforms, don't take their word, as they are commiting identity theft. _Identity theft is not a joke Jim.

Popular platforms I am not on:

[TikTok](https://tiktok.com) - I am not on TikTok for multiple reasons. The 2 main reasons why I never use TikTok are:

1. It has a plethora of privacy issues and is fully owned by a Chinese company

2. I don't have an interest in this type of video platform

Total times I visited TikTok directly (As of Thursday, March 4th 2021): `0` Total times I viewed TikTok content from another platform (reuploads, but not links, as that would be visiting TikTok directly): `85+`

It is NOT to be used for the Go programming language (which is very similarly named, and easily confusable)

### [‚ùîÔ∏è Why is Python your favorite programming language?](#-Why-is-Python-your-favorite-programming-language-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

See below for the full store. I was a big user of Scratch, and eventually got into real programming after transitioning to Python in my first AP computer science class. I really came to love Python, and I have the most knowledge in it out of other programming languages (markdown and markup languages (like HTML or Markdown) are not included in this summary)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

In 2015, I was switched from an incorrect class to a class I was supposed to be in, which changed my life completely: my 2015 Middle School computer programming class.

Although the class mainly just used Scratch, this is where my interest skyrocketed. I was a big user of Scratch, and eventually got into real programming after transitioning to Python in my first AP computer science class. I really came to love Python, and I have the most knowledge in it out of other programming languages (markdown and markup languages (like HTML or Markdown) are not included in this summary)

### [‚ùîÔ∏è How well can you program in Java?](#-How-well-can-you-program-in-Java-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I took an AP Java class, but I was missing too many stepping stones to fully get it. I did get several concepts of it, and this class familiarized me with Java quite a bit, along with using IDEs (Eclipse) I am not too good at Java, but I can do some basic stuff, not just Hello World programs. I can't write an entire program in Java though, I feel like my knowledge of Java basics and intermediate is 2.8%

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I have always been a linguist. I like the looks of all the different programming languages and their syntax. Also, some projects are dependant on some languages. When I create an IDE out of a language, I prefer to use that language to emulate that language.

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

It does in a way, but I don't have any good image platforms. Since GitHub is a version control site, and I add in content besides images, it fits pretty well, other than proper image viewing without downloading the repository.

I joined GitHub with the goal of collaboration. I am still building a following, and hope to have developers contributing to these projects based on their interest level in the project. There are so many of them, as I have been going through and adding new ideas as they come up.

I am not profitable yet, but I am working on it. Since I work in the FOSS industry, I rely on donations and sponsors. I will try to limit my usage of ads (and I will not make sketchy, crappy ads like Playrix's homescape, gardenscape, etc. ads, or ads like about 99.998% of the ads on Google Play)

Linux is great. I have had a really, really horrible experience with Windows 10, there is too much to get into. I intended to start with Fedora Linux, but I had to go with Ubuntu 20.04, as I feared that I might void my laptops warranty (which I don't want to do, since this laptop costs over $1.4K)

I have been trying to gain followers on GitHub so that I eventually get someone to help interact with me on my projects. It has been a very slow process.

I got my account suspended 3 days later, and along with other reasons, I decided not to do this again. All I had to do to unsuspend my account was re-verify my email address.

I have a lot of different projects. I have to manage lots of different projects. I have over 70 different Firefox profiles, each one containing their own set of tabs, however I only keep 1-3 profiles open at once. I close out of these when I finish with them for now.

I play games that have a general target of kids, but are also just past-time games. Examples include Restaurant/Bakery/Pet Shop/Fashion/Farm/City story, and Merge Plane. These games can be for both kids and adults. I played these games in my childhood, and have nostalgic ties to them. Some of them are just genuinely fun to begin with.

### [‚ùîÔ∏è Why do some of your projects use Go, Dart, or Flutter when you hate Google?](#-Why-do-some-of-your-projects-use-Go-Dart-or-Flutter-when-you-hate-Google-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I don't write the entire project in this language, and in the cases I do, it is required for archiving the data and making an IDE (SNU_2D_Programming_Tools) or just a general pun. The 1 project that uses it but is using a degoogled version [(Candroid)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid)

Also, a few projects are written in Go! (a language that came out over 4 years before Go) its creator got steamrolled and no-one ever really looks at his language due to Googles claim that Go! won't be confused with Go, and that "lots of other projects and languages have the same name" which is not true, Google. You steamrolled him.

Since Go! (2004) and Go (2008/2009) both use the .go file extension, GitHub's lingust feature identifies it as Go instead of Go! Both languages vary significantly in Syntax.

I have some personal opinions on GitHub. I am working on keeping them contained inside 3 repositories:

- [Opinions](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Opinions/) - Opinions are documented here
- [Politics](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Politics/) - My political views are listed here and should absolutely NOT leak anywhere else. I felt like I needed to make the point that I wouldn't stay silent on some things.

> Sub project: [Pro-fascist or Anti-fascist](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Profa_Or_Antifa/) - A small political project educating people on the difference between being pro-fascist (supporting dictators) and anti-fascist (opposing dictators)

- [Sexuality center](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_SexualityCenter/) - For my sexual views and preferences.

On GitHub, I have a lot of other personal projects, under the category of a life archive project, which I have been working on extra hard since 2016.

## [‚ôæÔ∏è Autism](#-Autism)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I am on the Autism spectrum. I am on the high functioning part of the spectrum, only suffering from socialization issues (which have gotten much better over my lifetime)

I don't consider my Autism to be a handicap. I feel like it is what makes me, me, and what makes me so outgoing, creative, and smart.

However, there are less fortunate people with Autism who have much more problems due to their position on the spectrum. That is why I have created the [United Autism Rights organization](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80805036?s=60&v=4) as [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#View_of_autism_as_a_disease)[u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#Cure_Autism_Now)[t](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/10/disability-community-condemns-autism-speaks/)[i](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/aug/07/health.medicineandhealth)[s](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger)[m](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/25/they-don-t-want-an-autism-cure.html) [S](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0824-silberman-autism-speaks-20150824-story.html)[p](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/aspergers-alive/201311/reporters-guide-the-autism-speaks-debacle)[e](https://web.archive.org/web/20180615032203/https://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2015/08/25/call-unity)[a](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630013301/http://www.gettingthewordout.org/home.php)[k](https://web.archive.org/web/20071018030910/http://gettingthetruthout.org/)[s](https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19726414.300-voices-of-autism-silenced-by-charity.html) is NOT helpful at all, and the other alternates currently aren't that effective.

I have many repositories. The majority of them are sub-projects to a main project (SNU)

My major projects are sorted into collectives. As of 2024, Friday, March 29th (the day collectives were established) there were 13 collectives, which include:

## [üì•Ô∏è Takeout Tuesdays](#-Takeout-Tuesdays)

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

I started doing it to do a data takeout of my Twitter accounts, so that I could safely have them deleted. I realized the importance of weekly backups, and turned it into a tradition, as doing a takeout of your website data is just as important as backing up your computers hard drive.

For further information, go to the official [:octocat: `Takeout Tuesdays repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Takeout_Tuesdays/)

There is a related project that gets fed data from Takeout Tuesday, which is known as [:octocat: `The REAL Data Liberation Front (TRDLF)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/The-REAL-Data-Liberation-Front/) which is a continuation of Googles Data Liberation Front, but with a stronger goal, and better commitment. It mostly documents the capability of doing data takeouts on other websites, and promotes a 30-31 day data takeout time, rather than a 4 to 7 day takeout time.

The justification for this is that some accounts for social media can be multiple terabytes in size, and data takeout cannot be done comfortably in 4 to 7 days when you have 8 terabytes of data, especially if you have weak Internet (it is hard even with Gigabit Internet, as you have to swap out hard drives, constantly download, and hope the power/Internet doesn't go out. Plus, even with fiberoptic Internet, the provider is usually slower than the Internet speed. Example: archive.org downloads at average between 400 kilobytes per second and 12 megabytes per second, even on a 900+ megabyte download speed connection)

## [üìëÔ∏è Browser tabs](#-Browser-tabs)

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

In order to maintain these projects, I have a lot of tabs open, so that I can work with them when needed, have faster access, and have the ability to queue tasks. This video showcases my nightly process of recording tabs, at a record point in 2024, March (where I had 1,242 tabs open) since I am not using a Chromium-based browser, it is easier to have this many tabs open, especially light ones. It requires nearly 40 gigabytes of RAM to have 1242 tabs open at once.

I felt that a more customized AI tool didn't exist, but more importantly, there were no ethical AI projects that I could find. Ethical AI has to be completely open source, and ChatGPT wasn't.

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Web -3 began to gain popularity around the time I joined GitHub. I was a little gullible around this time, and tried creating related projects without knowing the full context. The more I researched it, the more I disliked it.

The thing I hate the most about it are NFTs, and the audacity for this movement to call itself the 3rd iteration of the web. I prefer calling it [:octocat: `Web negative three`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Web-negative-3/)

Blockchain and crypto mining is bad for the environment, and it is actively hurting the name of crypto (which stands for cryptography, **not** cryptocurrency)

Nonetheless, due to my follow for follow promise, I still follow a lot of NFT/cryptocurrency bots that follow me.

- **See also:** [:octocat: `Seanpm2001 Fork Style Guide`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001_Fork_Style-Guide/)

I actively fork repositories on GitHub to act as an archive of repositories I have come across, and less often, repositories that I actively use. There is a problem that started with GitHub around 2022 regarding forks that I don't like:

Previously, if the account of a fork got suspended/deleted, you could still see "forked from johndoe/myrepository" at the top of the screen. It would be a dead link, but it would at least attribute the user. Nowadays, when this happens, the forked repository is instead turned into a source repository, which makes the suggestion that I created this repository, and it really messes with my timeline.

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
