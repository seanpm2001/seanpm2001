# Excerpt from the seanpm2001 life archive journal

## Entry 2022.07.16

```cob
PAUSE! {M2.tv} wait for resume()
resume{REDIRECT}(=1:
);//Execute resume()
when resume is executable:
start: 1-:-39-pm-PST
```

I will now define what this means: 

```cob
PAUSE! {M2.tv} wait for resume()
```

The first line declares that I have paused work on my journaling, the M2.tv parameter indicates that the TV is active, then the line ends with a wait statement for the resume function, which has not yet been defined (but in this weird language, this is fine)

```cob
resume{REDIRECT}(=1:
```

the second line defines the resume function, which will execute the redirect command. (I had to fix this quoted version, as part of line 2 was in line 3) next it defines that resume is to be executed inside itself when redirect is equal to 1 (which I forgot to add into the “program”)

```cob
when resume is executable:
```

On line 3, a when statement is defined, for when resume is able to be executed, in which line 4 says that the resume function will execute at 1:39 pm. 

```cob
start: 1-:-39-pm-PST
```

I like writing pseudo-languages.

## Editors notes:

I meant to say `am` instead of `pm`

This program was created as a note segment to describe the TV being a distraction from my journal

This program is useless.
