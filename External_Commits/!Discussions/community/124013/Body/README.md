# [Small feature request] Add language linguist color (circle pog) to all language entries in the language dropdown

This is a UI feature request. In some parts of the site, the pog (colored circle representing the language) is present next to the name of the language, while in other parts of the site (such as in the user profile language dropdown) it is not. It is not only a UI inconsistency, but it is something that would make the site look so much better.
