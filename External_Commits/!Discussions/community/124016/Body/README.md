# [Feature request] Increase discussion category limit from 25

For some projects, 25 discussion categories is not enough. I feel the cap should be raised to either 50, 100, 1000, or unlimited.

Also, GitHub doesn't give you a proper error when you try to create a 26th discussion category. See [:octocat: `#60075`](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/60075/)
