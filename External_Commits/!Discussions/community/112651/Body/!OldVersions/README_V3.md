It fixes itself after 10 minutes, but every 3rd repository (approximately) created has this bug. It has been consistent for about 2½ hours now. I would expect https://www.githubstatus.com/ to say something by now (this is the second major error this month that wasn't reported there, the other being uploads not working for around 9 hours)

This issue doesn't appear to be present while creating source repositories.
