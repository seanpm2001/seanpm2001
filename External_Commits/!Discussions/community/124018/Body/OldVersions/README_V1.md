# [Feature request] Double all upload size limits

The current size limitations for GitHub uploads are too low. 

> Social preview image: 1 MiB -> 2 MiB

I have had to downscale several images to 360p or 480p, as the 1 megabyte limit is too low. It should be doubled, as most other sites allow 2 megabyte image files here.

> File size limit: 25 MiB -> 50 MiB

This would be helpful for uploading files like Scratch 1, 2, and 3 project files (which cap out at 50 megabytes per project) along with longer videos, bigger images, and more complex binaries.

> GitHub issues/discussions: 64 KiB -> 128 KiB (or even 64 KiB -> 512 KiB)

Sometimes, a crash log requires more than 65,536 bytes of text, and some issues are split into multiple parts due to this limitation. Since a README preview can be up to 512 KiB before rendering issues start, why not increase the limit to 512 KiB to match the README.
