# Small feature request: Show all languages on user profile.

I feel there should be support for allowing all languages to be shown in the user profile dropdown, as like in the organization profile dropdown. The user profile dropdown seems to be limited to the top languages of the last 300 repositories worked on, while an organization will have a dropdown that shows every top language of every repository.
