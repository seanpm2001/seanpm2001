# [Feature request] Local embedded videos

Right now, when you put a video into a repository, it has to work solely through GitHub online storage (github-usercontent) and doesn't work when you try to link a local repository video. It would be great if the option to embed videos into Markdown could be done without relying on this server. This helps with preservation, and cross-platform support (when you import the repository to another site)
