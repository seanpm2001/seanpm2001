I feel there needs to be a small enhancement here. The preferred emoji skin tone selection menu does not specify that the preference is public and appears on your profile (notably through GitHub achievements) I feel a line like this should fix the problem:

```html
<p><b>Note:</b> Changes here will be made visible on your public GitHub profile.</p>
```

The text and source code should be reworked, as a disclaimer is necessary here.
