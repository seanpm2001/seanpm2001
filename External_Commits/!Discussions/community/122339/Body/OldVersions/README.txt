I like the new ability to pin workflows/actions in the list. It however has one flaw, which is that once you disable the workflow, the action is unpinned.

Some of my repositories have an action that has to be disabled temporarily so that I can commit files without triggering a workflow run. This means I have to disable the workflow, commit, re-enable the workflow, and in addition, re-pin the action.

It would be nice if actions stayed pinned after disabling the workflow and re-enabling it.
