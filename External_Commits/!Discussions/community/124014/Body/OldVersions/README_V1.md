# [Feature request] Show repository size on the repository homepage, like GitLab does

There is a helpful GitLab feature that GitHub is missing, which is a piece of information on each repository that shows not only the owner, but any collaborator or viewer,  how much storage space the repository is using.

I know you can go to a page on the user profile to see the repository size, but this isn't as helpful (especially when you aren't the owner) and also because that page only lets you view 1000 repositories. I also feel like not enough information is displayed.
