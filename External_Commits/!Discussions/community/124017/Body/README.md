# [Small feature request] Sort by license

It has been requested for years, I know. GitHub needs a way to sort a project by license. It currently only works in GitHub organizations, but it would be helpful if it could be done on the GitHub profile too. There are already 3 dropdown buttons on the user repositories page, but a fourth one could be fit in.

The licenses should have their own color pogs too (colored circle representing the language/license)
