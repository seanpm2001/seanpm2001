I have been working on a project utilizing discussions. A few days ago, I tried to create a 26th discussion category. It acted like it was going to go through, then the button turned back to the unpressed position, meaning it didn't. I tried multiple times, and even waited until the next day, but still nothing. So I went to look up what was happening, and I found that there was a 25 discussion category limit.

My proposal is that there should be an error popup when you try to create a 26th category, saying something like "Could not create new category: You have reached the limit of 25 discussion categories" it would have helped me solve this problem a lot faster. It is really confusing when something is going wrong, but no feedback is given.
