# [Bug] creating a new repository results in a 404

There has been a bug on GitHub for years, although a rather small one:

If you type [:octocat: `https://github.com/NEW`](https://github.com/NEW) it returns a 404, instead of redirecting to [:octocat: `https://github.com/new`](https://github.com/new)
