Cairo appears to be missing from the list. Here is how a Hello World program is written:

```cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;
fn main() {
    'Hello, World'.print();
}
```

According to [:octocat: `Cairo-book/Cairo-book.github.io`](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book.github.io/blob/main/src/ch01-02-hello-world.md)

The extension is `.cairo` so the file should be placed at `///C/Cairo.cairo`

This language should definitely be included, as it is notable enough to be listed in the GitHub Linguist, meaning it has a notable amount of usage by more than a handful of people.
