That does not happen for me. I am using the wildcard filter:

On another note, I just noticed it doesn't work if you have a URL with a chapter suffix like `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#Taxonomy`, apparently the skin part has to be between the article name and the chapter .. sigh. more complicated than I thought
