I don't have much more info. I did apply the exclude pattern. Basically, when I refresh the page, the link goes from:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page?useskin=monobook

to:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page?useskin=monobook?useskin=monobook

Which causes the theme to break. Additionally, this filter doesn't apply to viewing/editing the source for an article, but it works with talk pages.
