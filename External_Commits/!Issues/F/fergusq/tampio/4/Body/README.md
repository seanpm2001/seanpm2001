I have designed some graphics that you can use for this project. I see that this language doesn't have a logo, or social preview image, so I designed some for you. They are free to use. They were all made entirely in GIMP 2.10. Feel free to update your `README.md` file if you like them.

## Logos

## Wallpapers

These can be used as banners, or social preview images.

## Background

I didn't know what else to do for the logo, so I chose your profile picture, and used it as the backdrop, as it is a vibrant logo. The language name was added in blue, with a white line below it. These 2 colors represent üá´üáÆÔ∏è Finland.

## Misc

| (1920x1080) I tried designing a less fuzzy wallpaper, but I found using the 335px logo on a 1080p image didn't look as good as the upscaled 1024px logo on a 1080p image (they are the same source image, yet they vary significantly in quality) [:octocat: `Source`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Graphic-Design/blob/Seanpm2001_Graphic_Design/T/Tampio-Language/Wallpaper/1080p/PNG/HighCompression/TampioLanguage_1080pWallpaper_V1_Variant335px_HighCompression.png) |
