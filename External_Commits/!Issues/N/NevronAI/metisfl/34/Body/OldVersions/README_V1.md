### ðŸš€ The feature

NevronAI needs an SVG (vector) version of its logo, alongside the PNG (raster) version.

### Motivation

SVG is a great format for images, especially logos. The NevronAI logo is so simple, that an SVG logo would take hardly any time to make, and if done properly (not with InkScape, but by hand) would enable a very high resolution, scalable logo that takes up about 5-52x less space than the PNG version (I assume it would be somewhere between 200 bytes and 2000 bytes, rather than 10437 bytes) it would also make the logo readable by text editors, as it is a plain text format, rather than a binary format.

### Alternatives

No alternatives are available for this idea.

### Additional context

SVG is a very popular, and standardized vector image format. If an SVG Version is made, you can also keep the PNG versions separate, and not delete them. A raster image does not scale well, while a vector image does. There is still good reasoning for keeping the original PNG versions.
