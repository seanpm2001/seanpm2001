I mean technically it's still there: https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements#100--samples
The images as well, just not front and center.

The reason I've gone with the minimal version now is that those images are quite large. Which, for me, increased the load time noticeably while in my opinion not looking particular good in the table.

But:

   0. Thank you for noticing! :)
   1. Maybe I should change the link texts of the current sample links to make it more clear that they are leading to the live examples of 100 % achievements?
   2. I was thinking about moving the "full" 100 % section including the images being displayed to it's own markdown file, which wouldn't increase the README load time then, besides a link pointing there. What do you think?
   3. Also I made good progress today towards my ultimate goal to capture the 100 % achievements as SVGs, including the animation:
    (warning Currently they will look broken on github because of CORS. to see them proper you have to download them and then open in a browser)
    test2.svg & test6.svg
    I was prioritizing that ;)
