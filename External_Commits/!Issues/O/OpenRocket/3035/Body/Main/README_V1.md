I recently installed OpenRocket through the Snap store (Ubuntu 24.04) as I didn't find a Debian package. This is a fresh installation, and it appears to be broken. A component seems to be missing (as indicated by my screenshot) but I am unsure how to reinstall it. None of the 3D Models work, and I cannot run the simulation GUI. The snap also appears to be buggy, and will have the arrow key stuck down when I open a menu, until I give an interrupting key signal (the same goes for any input field, in which it will infinitely write the number 4, until I give it another input) This is my first time using OpenRocket, and I would appreciate any help I can get here. The font is also kind of weird, but I assume that is the default for this program, and I have no desire to change it.
