This is a feature request. Going up directories with `up` is helpful, but sometimes, you need to go down.

I don't feel `down` needs to be a separate command. I feel it should work with `up` as well, as you can't abbreviate the word down as easily (at least in English) and it doesn't need a separate command either. For example, if you wanted to go down 4 directories, you would type `up -4`
