### Pitch

Mastodon currently lets you hide both your follows and your following, but it can't be done separately. With a separation of these 2 settings, one could show who they are following and hide who follows them, or hide who they are following and show who can follow them.

### Motivation

I feel this little settings tweak is necessary, as some want to have a level of anonymity regarding who they follow, but are less lenient towards who follows them. This can also be reversed.
I don't think very much programming would be required to do this. Regarding if it could be done via a 3rd party app using the REST API, I am unsure.
