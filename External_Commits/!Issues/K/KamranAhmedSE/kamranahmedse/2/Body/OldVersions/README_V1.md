On your profile, it says

> I am also a Google Developer Expert and a GitHub Star. I am a huge fan of open-source and [have built projects](https://github.com/kamranahmedse?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers) used by millions.

However, the GitHub stars page lists 83 users, and [none match your real name or GitHub username](https://stars.github.com/profiles/)

Maybe it was there at one point, but got delisted for some reason? For now, it should be modified, maybe to this:

> I am also a Google Developer Expert, and a huge fan of open-source, and [have built projects](https://github.com/kamranahmedse?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers) used by millions.
