I came across this repository today when I was working with SWAP on a new system. My system has 96 Gibibytes (100.9 gigabytes) of RAM. The dropdown here doesn't list an option for 96 gigabytes. Additionally, more advanced systems contain more than 128 gigabytes of RAM, and some systems contain amounts of RAM not available in the current dropdown. Instead of making additions to the dropdown, a text box should be added, which allows for any valid number to be added, and converted into SWAP memory.
