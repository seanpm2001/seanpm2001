I updated the repository to replace almost all images with local links, by adding a `/Media/` folder. There were 2 images that kept breaking when I tried to replace them (the GitHub logo and the GitHub wordmark) these will need to be fixed later. I additionally added a `.gitattributes` file, so that this project detects Markdown as its main language.

Only PNG and GIF versions are available for now. I don't have the time or skill to convert them to clean SVG, so that is a task for the future.

I held off this task for almost 2 weeks, but I finally got it done. It took me over an hour to do this.
