I have been running this process for nearly a month. I have noted that it only says `No name` when it hasn't properly indexed all repositories. It appears to be random, some days it works, some days it doesn't. It will work eventually if you let it run enough times. Although inconvenient, this is what I have observed. The stats should appear when it runs correctly as well. Try running it for 14 days and sample the results.
