<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I am opposed to the Service as a Software Substitute (SaaS/SaaSS) model, as it enables closed source software, and creates a system of software, where once the server goes down in the long term, the software can never be used again, and all effort that went into creating it is gone. I want to create permanent software, which is why I use various methods of archival and preservation in my work. The problem with SaaSS prompted me to start the UnSaaSS project, which aims to replicate certain SaaSS software functionality without the requirement of a server, or proprietary closed source software.

The project is a community effort that is currently on hold. It can be found [:octocat: `here (seanpm2001/UnSaaSS)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/UnSaaSS) note: preserving hyperlinks is one of the last unsolved problems in my archive process.
