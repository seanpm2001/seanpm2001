Web -3 began to gain popularity around the time I joined GitHub. I was a little gullible around this time, and tried creating related projects without knowing the full context. The more I researched it, the more I disliked it.

The thing I hate the most about it are NFTs, and the audacity for this movement to call itself the 3rd iteration of the web. I prefer calling it [:octocat: `Web negative three`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Web-negative-3/)

Blockchain and crypto mining is bad for the environment, and it is actively hurting the name of crypto (which stands for cryptography, **not** cryptocurrency)

Nonetheless, due to my follow for follow promise, I still follow a lot of NFT/cryptocurrency bots that follow me.
