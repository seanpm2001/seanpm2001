I have a project that documents my operating system data and usage (not individual files, but their structure, along with the operating system and its settings) data is kept in a unique way, with each operating system family gaining its own galaxy within a universe.

The project can be found [:octocat: `here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansOSData/)
