Takeout Tuesdays is a personal event of mine, where data takeout is prioritized once a week on Tuesday. This tradition started for me on 2023, Tuesday, June 6th. You can adopt the tradition as well if you want.

I started doing it to do a data takeout of my Twitter accounts, so that I could safely have them deleted. I realized the importance of weekly backups, and turned it into a tradition, as doing a takeout of your website data is just as important as backing up your computers hard drive.

There is a related project that gets fed data from Takeout Tuesday, which is known as [:octocat: `The REAL Data Liberation Front (TRDLF)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/The-REAL-Data-Liberation-Front/) which is a continuation of Googles Data Liberation Front, but with a stronger goal, and better commitment. It mostly documents the capability of doing data takeouts on other websites, and promotes a 30-31 day data takeout time, rather than a 4 to 7 day takeout time.

The justification for this is that some accounts for social media can be multiple terabytes in size, and data takeout cannot be done comfortably in 4 to 7 days when you have 8 terabytes of data, especially if you have weak Internet (it is hard even with Gigabit Internet, as you have to swap out hard drives, constantly download, and hope the power/Internet doesn't go out. Plus, even with fiberoptic Internet, the provider is usually slower than the Internet speed. Example: archive.org downloads at average between 400 kilobytes per second and 12 megabytes per second, even on a 900+ megabyte download speed connection)
