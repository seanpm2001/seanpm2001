| Linguistics |

I have been a linguist since my early childhood. I jokingly changed my middle name to `language` in my early childhood, but I think it would fit as a 2nd middle name.

| Cyrillic Zhe sample –ñ |

I like the look and sound of various languages, whether they are human spoken or machine instructions. Unfortunately, I can't write completely in a language other than English, Python, HTML, or markdown.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Georgian/Damts'erloba.svg" alt="Georgian language sample" title="Sample Georgian language text" width="695" height="154" align="left"> |
|---|
| Georgian language |

Georgian is an interesting language to me that expanded my interest in Linguistics around 2018-2019.

|---|
| Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs |

I have interest in hieroglyph languages, Ancient Egyptian was the first one I saw.

| Tifinagh alphabet (Berber languages) |

I like the aethetics of the Berber language, it was a highlight of mine in 2019. I used to play with the Windows character map looking at languages, and this was one that really caught my eye.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Japanese/Nihongo.svg" alt="Japanese language sample" title="Japanese language sample" width="200" height="448"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Chinese/Chineselanguage.svg" alt="Chinese language sample" title="Chinese language sample" width="350" height="568"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Korean/Hangugeo-Chosonmal.svg" alt="Korean language sample" title="Korean language sample" width="263" height="371"> |
|---|---|---|
| Japanese | Chinese | Korean |

I am easily able to tell the difference between the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean languages, although I can't read/write in them, and I only know how to say a handful of words in these languages.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Gothic/Wulfila_bibel.jpeg" alt="Gothic language sample" title="Gothic language sample" width="350" height="440" align="left"> |

| Gothic language |

One day, I was browsing Wiktionary, and I discovered the Gothic language. It has a really cool alphabet. My favorite letter in the Gothic alphabet is `êå∏`

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Greek/Greekalphabet.svg" alt="Greek alphabet" title="The Greek Alphabet" width="450" height="55" align="right"> |
|---|
| Greek language |

Greek is another interesting language. I am actively memorizing and researching the language.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Icelandic/Icelandic-Alphabet.png" alt="Icelandic alphabet" title="The Icelandic Alphabet" width="1521" height="242" align="center"> |
|---|
| Icelandic alphabet |

Functionally speaking, if I were to use another language other than English as my preferred primary language, I would choose Icelandic. It is functional, and fits with me well.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Latin/Abecedarium_latinum_clasicum.svg" alt="Latin alphabet" title="The Latin Alphabet" width="438" height="168" align="left"> |
|---|
| Latin alphabet |

I know several Latin phrases, but, like most people, I speak a language that uses the Latin script, but not Latin itself. I also know that Latin has a lot more letters than what is typically seen, there are close to 500 Latin letters (when you account acutes, diacritics, and other letters)

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Ukrainian/Ukrainian_alphabet_in_capital_letters.svg" alt="Ukrainian alphabet" title="The Ukrainian alphabet" width="670" height="360" align="right"> |
|---|
| Ukrainian alphabet |

I have been trying to learn the Ukrainian language instead of the Russian language since 2022. I set a goal in 2023 to learn 1 Ukrainian word per day, but unfortunately, I stopped after about 40 days. Ukrainian is very mutually intelligible with the Belarusian and Russian languages.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Armenian/Armenian_Alphabet_Uppercase_lowercase_and_transcription.svg" alt="Armenian alphabet" title="The Armenian alphabet" width="670" height="360" align="left"> |
|---|
| Armenian alphabet |

Armenian is another unique looking language. I have yet to learn a single word in Armenian.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Arabic/Arabic_albayancalligraphy.svg" alt="Arabic calligraphy" title="Arabic sample" width="686" height="302" align="right"> |
|---|
| Arabic language |

I know some words in Arabic. It is a hard language for me to learn, as it contains a different script, and the writing direction is right to left, instead of left to right.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Cuneiform/Cuneiform_pictographic_signs_(vertical).jpeg" alt="Cuneiform text sample" title="Cuneiform text sample" width="567" height="513" align="left"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Cuneiform/Xerxes_Cuneiform_Van.jpeg" alt="Cuneiform carving" title="Cuneiform carving" width="691" height="590"> |
|---|---|
| Cuneiform minor | Cuneiform major |

I learned how to write a little bit in Cuneiform. It isn't a skill I use very often, as it is not needed very much nowadays.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Hebrew/Alefbet_ivri.svg" alt="Hebrew text sample" title="Hebrew text sample" width="567" height="513" align="right"> |
|---|
| Hebrew language |

Hebrew is another right to left language, and has interesting simplicity in its writing system. I know few words in Hebrew.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Mongolian/Monggol_kele.svg" alt="Mongolian text sample" title="Mongolian text sample" width="135" height="405" align="left"> |
|---|
| Classic Mongolian language |

Mongolian is a unique language, as it is written vertically, instead of horizontally. The modern version of the Mongolian language isn't as unique, as it just uses Cyrillic.

·†Æ·†£·†©·†≠·†£·†Ø ·†¨·†°·†Ø·†°

Unfortunately, Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 by default don't support a font that supports the classic Mongolian lannguage.

| ‚≠êÔ∏è Overview |
|---|

I have a strong interest in linguistics, it doesn't matter the language, the writing system, the age, the history, etc. I just like learning about new languages. This interest also has expanded into programming languages. I divide it up like this:

| ‚úçÔ∏è Type | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sample |
|---|---|
| Human spoken languages | English |
| Programming language | Python |
| Markup language | HTML |
