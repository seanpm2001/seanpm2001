I am a intermediate photographer, and can take really good pictures without the need of manipulating the original image to make it better (other than the times I accidentally get my thumb in the shot) I can take photos for you when needed. My current camera is 4K (2160p, or 2K) 60 frames per second.

I am an avid video game player, playing various video games to pass time, relax, have fun, and come up with new ideas. I am also a card game player, but I need extra help playing most card games due to a learning curve and limited knowledge on card games.

Lately, I mainly play mobile games, but from time to time, I will use a video game console, or RetroPie on my Raspberry Pi.

### [üàØÔ∏è Linguistics](#-Linguistics)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

| <img src="/Graphics/Hobbies/Linguistics/Linguistics1.jpeg" alt="Original linguistics profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" title="Linguistics icon 1" width="100" height="100" align="left"> |
|---|
| Linguistics |

I have been a linguist since my early childhood. I jokingly changed my middle name to `language` in my early childhood, but I think it would fit as a 2nd middle name.

| <img src="/Graphics/Hobbies/Linguistics/Cyrillic_letter_Zhe_-_uppercase_and_lowercase.svg" alt="Original linguistics:Cyrillic profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" title="Cyrillic text sample" width="100" height="100" align="right"> |
|---|
| Cyrillic Zhe sample –ñ |

I like the look and sound of various languages, whether they are human spoken or machine instructions. Unfortunately, I can't write completely in a language other than English, Python, HTML, or markdown.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Georgian/Damts'erloba.svg" alt="Georgian language sample" title="Sample Georgian language text" width="695" height="154" align="left"> |
|---|
| Georgian language |

Georgian is an interesting language to me that expanded my interest in Linguistics around 2018-2019.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Ancient-Egyptian-Hieroglpyhs/Minnakht_01.jpeg" alt="Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyph sample" title="Ancient Egyptiona Hieroglphy sample" width="1024" height="768" align="right"> |
|---|
| Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs |

I have interest in hieroglyph languages, Ancient Egyptian was the first one I saw.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Berber/Tifinagh_alphabet.png" alt="Berber (Tifinagh) alphabet sample" title="The Tifinagh alphabet" width="928" height="620" align="left"> |
|---|
| Tifinagh alphabet (Berber languages) |

I like the aethetics of the Berber language, it was a highlight of mine in 2019. I used to play with the Windows character map looking at languages, and this was one that really caught my eye.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Japanese/Nihongo.svg" alt="Japanese language sample" title="Japanese language sample" width="200" height="448"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Chinese/Chineselanguage.svg" alt="Chinese language sample" title="Chinese language sample" width="350" height="568"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Korean/Hangugeo-Chosonmal.svg" alt="Korean language sample" title="Korean language sample" width="263" height="371"> |
|---|---|---|
| Japanese | Chinese | Korean |

I am easily able to tell the difference between the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean languages, although I can't read/write in them, and I only know how to say a handful of words in these languages.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Gothic/Wulfila_bibel.jpeg" alt="Gothic language sample" title="Gothic language sample" width="350" height="440" align="left"> |
|---|
| Gothic language |

One day, I was browsing Wiktionary, and I discovered the Gothic language. It has a really cool alphabet. My favorite letter in the Gothic alphabet is `êå∏`

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Greek/Greekalphabet.svg" alt="Greek alphabet" title="The Greek Alphabet" width="450" height="55" align="right"> |
|---|
| Greek language |

Greek is another interesting language. I am actively memorizing and researching the language.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Icelandic/Icelandic-Alphabet.png" alt="Icelandic alphabet" title="The Icelandic Alphabet" width="1521" height="242" align="center"> |
|---|
| Icelandic alphabet |

Functionally speaking, if I were to use another language other than English as my preferred primary language, I would choose Icelandic. It is functional, and fits with me well.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Latin/Abecedarium_latinum_clasicum.svg" alt="Latin alphabet" title="The Latin Alphabet" width="438" height="168" align="left"> |
|---|
| Latin alphabet |

I know several Latin phrases, but, like most people, I speak a language that uses the Latin script, but not Latin itself. I also know that Latin has a lot more letters than what is typically seen, there are close to 500 Latin letters (when you account acutes, diacritics, and other letters)

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Ukrainian/Ukrainian_alphabet_in_capital_letters.svg" alt="Ukrainian alphabet" title="The Ukrainian alphabet" width="670" height="360" align="right"> |
|---|
| Ukrainian alphabet |

I have been trying to learn the Ukrainian language instead of the Russian language since 2022. I set a goal in 2023 to learn 1 Ukrainian word per day, but unfortunately, I stopped after about 40 days. Ukrainian is very mutually intelligible with the Belarusian and Russian languages.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Armenian/Armenian_Alphabet_Uppercase_lowercase_and_transcription.svg" alt="Armenian alphabet" title="The Armenian alphabet" width="670" height="360" align="left"> |
|---|
| Armenian alphabet |

Armenian is another unique looking language. I have yet to learn a single word in Armenian.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Arabic/Arabic_albayancalligraphy.svg" alt="Arabic calligraphy" title="Arabic sample" width="686" height="302" align="right"> |
|---|
| Arabic language |

I know some words in Arabic. It is a hard language for me to learn, as it contains a different script, and the writing direction is right to left, instead of left to right.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Cuneiform/Cuneiform_pictographic_signs_(vertical).jpeg" alt="Cuneiform text sample" title="Cuneiform text sample" width="567" height="513" align="left"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Cuneiform/Xerxes_Cuneiform_Van.jpeg" alt="Cuneiform carving" title="Cuneiform carving" width="691" height="590"> |
|---|---|
| Cuneiform minor | Cuneiform major |

I learned how to write a little bit in Cuneiform. It isn't a skill I use very often, as it is not needed very much nowadays.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Hebrew/Alefbet_ivri.svg" alt="Hebrew text sample" title="Hebrew text sample" width="567" height="513" align="right"> |
|---|
| Hebrew language |

Hebrew is another right to left language, and has interesting simplicity in its writing system. I know few words in Hebrew.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Mongolian/Monggol_kele.svg" alt="Mongolian text sample" title="Mongolian text sample" width="135" height="405" align="left"> |
|---|
| Classic Mongolian language |

Mongolian is a unique language, as it is written vertically, instead of horizontally. The modern version of the Mongolian language isn't as unique, as it just uses Cyrillic.

·†Æ·†£·†©·†≠·†£·†Ø ·†¨·†°·†Ø·†°

Unfortunately, Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 by default don't support a font that supports the classic Mongolian lannguage.

| ‚≠êÔ∏è Overview |
|---|

I have a strong interest in linguistics, it doesn't matter the language, the writing system, the age, the history, etc. I just like learning about new languages. This interest also has expanded into programming languages. I divide it up like this:

| ‚úçÔ∏è Type | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sample |
|---|---|
| Human spoken languages | English |
| Programming language | Python |
| Markup language | HTML |

### [‚åõÔ∏è History buff](#-History-buff)

<img src="/Graphics/Hobbies/History/FortressBase.png" alt="Original history buff profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" title="Castle/fortress image"  width="100" height="100" align="left"> 

I am a history buff, with knowledge of history spanning back over 13.8 billion years ago (Big Bang) to the current day. I like to learn about history, and I have knowledge of a large assortment of eras and events, including extensive knowledge of things other than World War I or World War II (but I also still know a lot about the 2 world wars) for Earth history, my knowledge goes back to 8000 BCE in extensive detail, down to 27000 BCE in less detail, and mostly geological events before 27000 BCE. I like to learn all types of history, and not just the history of warfare.

I owe my interest in history to my first High School history teacher, who was really enthusiastic about what he was teaching, and was just a general awesome and nice history teacher. I would no doubt make him teacher of the year for that year of High School. Past history classes never got me too into the subject of history, but this one really opened my mind to history.

Pretty much anything, but mainly:

- Europe
- World War I
- World War II
- American Revolutionary War

<img src="/Graphics/Hobbies/Journaling/JournalIcon1.png" alt="Original journaling profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" title="Journal icon" width="100" height="100" align="left"> 

I keep a daily journal. I have been on and off with this for most of my childhood, until sticking with it every day since September 26th 2016.

The journaling project is part of my life archive project, a digital archive of my entire life.

As of August 7th 2021, the main journal has over 7 million words. I average between 1358-2500/2500-3600/3600-13000 words per day (depending on what happens that day and how much I have to talk about)

I plan to publish the full journal on Tuesday, May 15th 2040. For now, certain related media, and certain templates are public, but several terabytes of data is private (the full journal takes up over 8 gigabytes of space, just for the journal, due to usage of images over a ~5 year period)

In 2024, April, I have become increasigly interested in GPS technology, and as a side project, I am working on a Location Positioning System (LPS) for my house that works offline.

I have a strong interest in music. I keep a collection of all of the songs I have ever listened to, with almost 99.8% accuracy. The majority of it is video game music.

I keep a copy of the shell of the database on GitHub, while most files aren't capable of being uploaded due to size limits and legal restrictions.
