### [🧾️ Certifications](#-Certifications)

During my time in High School, I went through a Microsoft Office course, and was certified to be a Microsoft Office specialist in Word 2013, Excel 2013, PowerPoint 2013, and Access 2013. Less than 3 years after gaining these certificates, I completely stopped using Microsoft Office in favor of LibreOffice, with rare exceptions for Virtual Machine usage. I feel the certifications are still helpful, as the knowledge carries on to other programs (LibreOffice Writer, LibreOffice Sheets, LibreOffice Impress, LibreOffice Data)

> **Note:** When I took these off my wall to get pictures on 2024, Friday, April 26th, I had some issues with reflections and glare. I also broke one of the frames, and will need to get a replacement.
