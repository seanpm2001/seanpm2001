**All organizations** _(As of March 27th 2021)_

This list is not maintained. For complete documentation of my organizations, see the [:octocat: `GitHub Organization Info`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info)/ repository.

As of 2022, August 5th, I was forced to delete all 1000 of my organizations. I deleted all of them by August 14th, but 2 still remain (they cannot be deleted or interacted with, even by me, but they still claim to exist)

Note: my organizations had multiple purposes, but most of them aimed to serve as a categorized. collection of projects, or a homepage for a project.
