I had previously feared Artificial Intelligence, as I didn't know much about it. In 2020, I began to experiment with Artificial Intelligence, and by 2022, I had created the [:octocat: `AI2001 repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001/) due to the AI boom caused by ChatGPT. I felt that a more customized AI tool didn't exist, but more importantly, there were no ethical AI projects that I could find. Ethical AI has to be completely open source, and ChatGPT wasn't.
