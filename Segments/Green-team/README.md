<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have 2 teams for my organization system. Blue team is for technical work (digital, analog, hardware, software) and green team is for environmental, and biology work. I am part of the green team, but I am also part of the blue team.
