Confetti was introduced to GitHub in late 2021, and appears each time you raise your first discussion. It was really cool to me at the time, so I took a video of it. I have seen it thousands of times now.

GitHub doesn't allow permanent video embed links that let you see the file in the README (like you can do with images) so I am linking to the file for now.
