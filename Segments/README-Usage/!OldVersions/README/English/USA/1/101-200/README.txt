If you have been sent here through a link through SMS (text messaging) congratulations! You are a close friend, and one of 73 people/bots who have access to my phone number and have been approved by me. If you would like, you can take a quick look at my [texting guidelines](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SMS-Messaging-with-Sean), or to put it simply: don't spam, don't share my number, and feel free to message me and send me anything at any time (even midnight, or 3:22 am) I likely won't respond immediately, but I will get to you when I am awake.
