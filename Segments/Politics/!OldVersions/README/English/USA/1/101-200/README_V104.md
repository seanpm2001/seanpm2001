### [üó≥Ô∏è Politics](#-Politics)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

This is considered one of my 3 sensitive areas. I cannot discuss it further here.

- [:octocat: `Politics`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Politics/) - My political views are listed here and should absolutely NOT leak anywhere else. I felt like I needed to make the point that I wouldn't stay silent on some things.
- - Sub project: [Pro-fascist or Anti-fascist](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Profa_Or_Antifa/) - A small political project educating people on the difference between being pro-fascist (supporting dictators) and anti-fascist (opposing dictators)
