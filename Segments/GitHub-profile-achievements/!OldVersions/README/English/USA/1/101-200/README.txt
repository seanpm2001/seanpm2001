<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

GitHub released achievements in 2020, with the arctic code vault achievement, and later the mars rover achievement. More mainstream achievements were added in 2022. I have earned some of them, but don't actively seek them. I have helped with documentation on other peoples repositories regarding achievements.

**This section needs expansion**
