### [üí≥Ô∏è License](#-License)

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

The majority of my repositories use the GNU General Public License version 3. I very rarely use other licenses. The second most common is the Unlicense, the third most common is the Vim license.

I renounce all Copyright to my projects, regardless of their license, and replaced that Copyright with Copyleft.
