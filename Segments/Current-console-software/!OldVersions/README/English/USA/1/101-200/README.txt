| Nintendo Wii (2009) |

| _The Family Wii, had a disc read error in 2023, and refused to turn on for a few days, but still works 15 years later. Initially used for New Super Mario Bros Wii, but it was rooted, and The Homebrew Channel was installed, so that emulated games could be played. Lots of memories here._ |
