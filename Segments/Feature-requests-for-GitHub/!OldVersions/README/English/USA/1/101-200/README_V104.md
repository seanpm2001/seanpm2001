There are some features that would be nice for GitHub. They include:

**Entries marked with `⭐` are highest priority**

> * The ability to follow organizations ⭐ (added to the site on 2022, March 21st) ✅️

> * An increased file upload size (25 MB > 50 MB or higher) so that larger files can be uploaded, including maximum size Scratch 1, 2, and 3 projects ⭐

> * A built-in dark mode, along with other modes (if needed) (added to the site around 2021) ✅️

> * Adding back the ability to hover over and see commit percentages ⭐

> * Support for Go! (2004 language by Francis McCabe) (to distinguish from Go (2009 Google language))

> * Better documentation for GitHub Emoji Skin tone

> * Repository size information on the repository itself (as GitLab does it)

> * No other requests at the moment
