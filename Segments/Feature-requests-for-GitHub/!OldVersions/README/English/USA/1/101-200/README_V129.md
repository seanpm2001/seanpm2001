I went and created 8 discussions for feature ideas on 2024, Wednesday, May 15th, although I planned to split across 8 days. Here was my original plan:

```plain-text
Add language linguist color (circle pog) to all language entries in the language dropdown (2024.05.15)
Repository size information on the repository itself (as GitLab does it) (2024.05.16)
Allow for adding labels to multiple issues/discussions at once (2024.05.17)
Increase discussion category limit from 25 (2024.05.18)
Sort by license (2024.05.19)
An increased file upload size (25 MB > 50 MB or higher) so that larger files can be uploaded, including maximum size Scratch 1, 2, and 3 projects (2024.05.20)
Fix some link errors, such as [:octocat: `https://github.com/NEW`](https://github.com/NEW) returning a 404, instead of redirecting to [:octocat: `https://github.com/new`](https://github.com/new) (2024.05.21)
Allow embedded videos in Markdown that rely on local repository files, instead of files solely on the GitHub user content server (2024.05.22)
```

There are still a few discussions I need to make.
