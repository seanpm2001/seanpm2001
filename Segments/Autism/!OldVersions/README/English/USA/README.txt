I am on the Autism spectrum. I am on the high functioning part of the spectrum, only suffering from socialization issues (which have gotten much better over my lifetime)

I don't consider my Autism to be a handicap. I feel like it is what makes me, me, and what makes me so outgoing, creative, and smart.

However, there are less fortunate people with Autism who have much more problems due to their position on the spectrum. That is why I have created the [United Autism Rights organization](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80805036?s=60&v=4) as [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#View_of_autism_as_a_disease)[u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#Cure_Autism_Now)[t](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/10/disability-community-condemns-autism-speaks/)[i](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/aug/07/health.medicineandhealth)[s](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger)[m](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/25/they-don-t-want-an-autism-cure.html) [S](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0824-silberman-autism-speaks-20150824-story.html)[p](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/aspergers-alive/201311/reporters-guide-the-autism-speaks-debacle)[e](https://web.archive.org/web/20180615032203/https://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2015/08/25/call-unity)[a](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630013301/http://www.gettingthewordout.org/home.php)[k](https://web.archive.org/web/20071018030910/http://gettingthetruthout.org/)[s](https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19726414.300-voices-of-autism-silenced-by-charity.html) is NOT helpful at all, and the other alternates currently aren't that effective.
