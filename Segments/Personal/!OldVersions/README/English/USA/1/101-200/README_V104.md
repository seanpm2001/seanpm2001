<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have some personal opinions on GitHub. I am working on keeping them contained inside 3 repositories:

- [:octocat: `Opinions`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Opinions/) - Opinions are documented here
- [:octocat: `Politics`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Politics/) - My political views are listed here and should absolutely NOT leak anywhere else. I felt like I needed to make the point that I wouldn't stay silent on some things.
- - Sub project: [Pro-fascist or Anti-fascist](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Profa_Or_Antifa/) - A small political project educating people on the difference between being pro-fascist (supporting dictators) and anti-fascist (opposing dictators)
- [:octocat: `Sexuality center`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_SexualityCenter/) - For my sexual views and preferences.

On GitHub, I have a lot of other personal projects, under the category of a life archive project, which I have been working on extra hard since 2016.
