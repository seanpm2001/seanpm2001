[GitHubby](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHubby/) - A tool to customize GitHub to make its appearance and functionality similar to past versions of GitHub. It requires heavy communication with the GitHub API to work. It is not functional yet.

[Setup Go! (Go2004) GitHub action](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Setup-Go2004-GitHubAction) - This is my first GitHub action. It allows continous integration (CI) with GitHub projects written in the Go! programming language. It is NOT to be used for the Go programming language (which is very similarly named, and easily confusable)
