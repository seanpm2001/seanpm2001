#### [üê°Ô∏è BSD platform support](#-BSD-platform-support)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

- [x] Mac OS X (10.0-12.0) (Partially supported)
- [x] iOS (partially supported)

I plan to support BSD more in the future when I know more about it. (MacOS counts as BSD, I think)
