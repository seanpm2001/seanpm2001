| 🧠 The "AI" question 🖥️ |
|---|

I am a digital artisan who does not use "AI" (Artificial Intelligence) in my works. I am committed to not using "AI" in any of my works, as it lacks originality. AI2001 is my only "AI" project, and it is currently on shaky grounds. More information on the Digital Artisan program will be published later this year. Any use of "AI" content will be made as clear as possible.

This is not a Luddite/technophobic stance, nor is it Neo-Luddite stance. I am not trying to stay in the past. "AI" has some good uses, but right now, it is being overused with the wrong purposes, and the "AI" bubble is going to burst eventually. Humans should not try to obsolete themselves, and it is increasingly frustrating to not be able to tell whether something is genuine (man-made, with effort, and creativity) or some lazily made "AI" slop that has no effort, no soul, and no creativity. The Internet is being destroyed by "AI" slop, as it is being spammed everywhere, and bringing down sites with it (due to flooding them with garbage, and/or eating up all of their bandwidth, hence, why we have so many more verification checks on sites we visit)

"AI" is also committing mass-scale Copyright infringement, this is not a reason in my opposition, as I believe in the public domain.

Support artists. I am a digital artisan

Digital Artisan level: II

Again, more information on the Digital Artisan program will be published later this year.

By the way, have you noticed that all software that implements/uses "AI" (and also some other software too) is starting to turn to absolute crap? Computers are becomingly increasingly frustrating to use, as they are experiencing bloated UI (dropdown menu within a dropdown menu, even when the first dropdown could have easily contained everything in the second dropdown without looking bad **cough** GNOME 46, Windows 11 **cough**) feature cuts, and decreased performance, even as hardware becomes more and more powerful. Sure, the systems of 2007 CE and below had their problems, but they worked really well (and in most cases, did much more in their UI) even on lower end hardware.

Also, I am very disappointed with the actions GitHub is currently committing by including Grok (a known Neo-Nazi "AI" platform) into GitHub CoPilot. I don't use CoPilot, and never will, especially while it fuels the fascist Elon Musk.

<details><summary><p><b>Definition of Nazi Bar (Wiktionary) (contains swearing)</b></p></summary>

Popularized by an anecdote shared by Michael B. Tager (@IamRageSparkle) on Twitter in July 2020. Tager recounted visiting a "shitty crustpunk bar" where he saw a patron abruptly expelled: the bartender explained that the man was wearing "iron crosses and stuff", and that he feared such patrons would become regulars and start bringing friends if not promptly kicked out, which would lead him to realize "oh shit, this is a Nazi bar now" only after the unwanted patrons became too "entrenched" to kick out without trouble. (Instances of people noting that if a bar starts serving Nazis other customers stop going and it becomes a Nazi bar are older.)
