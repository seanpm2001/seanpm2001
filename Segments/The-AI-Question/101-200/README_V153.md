| 🧠 The "AI" question 🖥️ |
|---|

I am a digital artisan who does not use "AI" (Artificial Intelligence) in my works. I am committed to not using "AI" in any of my works, as it lacks originality. AI2001 is my only "AI" project, and it is currently on shaky grounds. More information on the Digital Artisan program will be published later this year. Any use of "AI" content will be made as clear as possible.

This is not a Luddite/technophobic stance, nor is it Neo-Luddite stance. I am not trying to stay in the past. "AI" has some good uses, but right now, it is being overused with the wrong purposes, and the "AI" bubble is going to burst eventually. Humans should not try to obsolete themselves, and it is increasingly frustrating to not be able to tell whether something is genuine (man-made, with effort, and creativity) or some lazily made "AI" slop that has no effort, no soul, and no creativity. The Internet is being destroyed by "AI" slop, as it is being spammed everywhere, and bringing down sites with it (due to flooding them with garbage, and/or eating up all of their bandwidth, hence, why we have so many more verification checks on sites we visit)

"AI" is also committing mass-scale Copyright infringement, this is not a reason in my opposition, as I believe in the public domain.

Support artists. I am a digital artisan

Digital Artisan level: II

Again, more information on the Digital Artisan program will be published later this year.

By the way, have you noticed that all software that implements/uses "AI" (and also some other software too) is starting to turn to absolute crap? Computers are becomingly increasingly frustrating to use, as they are experiencing bloated UI (dropdown menu within a dropdown menu, even when the first dropdown could have easily contained everything in the second dropdown without looking bad **cough** GNOME 46, Windows 11 **cough**) feature cuts, and decreased performance, even as hardware becomes more and more powerful. Sure, the systems of 2007 CE and below had their problems, but they worked really well (and in most cases, did much more in their UI) even on lower end hardware.

Also, I am very disappointed with the actions GitHub is currently committing by including Grok (a known Neo-Nazi "AI" platform) into GitHub CoPilot. I don't use CoPilot, and never will, especially while it fuels the fascist Elon Musk.

The :octocat: GitHub community should act before GitHub [`becomes a Nazi bar`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar/)

<details><summary><p><b>Definition of Nazi Bar (Wiktionary) (contains swearing)</b></p></summary>

Popularized by an anecdote shared by Michael B. Tager (@IamRageSparkle) on Twitter in July 2020. Tager recounted visiting a "shitty crustpunk bar" where he saw a patron abruptly expelled: the bartender explained that the man was wearing "iron crosses and stuff", and that he feared such patrons would become regulars and start bringing friends if not promptly kicked out, which would lead him to realize "oh shit, this is a Nazi bar now" only after the unwanted patrons became too "entrenched" to kick out without trouble. (Instances of people noting that if a bar starts serving Nazis other customers stop going and it becomes a Nazi bar are older.)

```
hey what I want to know is why is everyone still sugar coating AI, is it not perfectly clear at this point
that all AI by design can never attain relavance? Is it not clear that giant bundles of 100 IQ conversations
are not helping at all with searches? Is it not clear that the whole idea is trash? I think with my human brain,
unfortunately now I have to think five times as hard because all the AI's are now incompetent and always were,
by design. Here try this, take your order for your next McDonalds trip get it exactly right, and let any AI
place it for you and tell me how it arrives if it ever does? see my point? You won't get what you want you'll
get what the AI chose from a list of ten million other orders. How does that help you? Well it helps a lot if
you have absolutely no idea what eating is or have never been human before because AI is explaining and choosing
for you as if you're as stupid and noobish as it is. It will never rise above the cognition we have while it's
based on our data, why would anyone invest in a technology that is limited to always be average at it's highest
potential??? Do I need AI thinking when I search for term matches? When you search do you want the search to match
your words or show you a shit ton of results and none of them contain your terms because AI figured out that
if you want corona wire for a Canon Copier you must want the entire history of Canon USA and Copiers and all
about how copiers function and the offices they can be used in and guaranteed all the facts are wrong, and theres
nothing listed relating to corona wires. Are we an incompetent world now, are people so stupid now that AI
garbage results actually help them in some way? I'm sorry I would trade Google from five years ago for the garbage
we have today in a heartbeat. I want one of you genius engineers to explain to me how sending my query through
terrabytes[sic] of common conversations clarifies what I freaking am looking for? One person explain to me where my
question is in those conversations where the decoding of my query is in that dataset??? The current morons can't
even see it I see hundreds of articles now saying AI is SO GOOD people are geting results and not clicking
anything because the answer is right there look up no click searches, if freakin idiotic, AI is that good, what's
really happening is people are entering search terms getting disgusted with zero usable results an trying different
search engines and never clicking results. But their interpretation is AI is so incredible that once hey hit
inter[sic] on their search query they never have to hit another button everything they want is listed and their
life is gold forever forward

@seanpm2001: 2025.12.03 (censored version, 1 expletive censored, otherwise, verbatim)

Increasingly lately, I have seen that software is going to s**t. There are constant instances of features being removed, or made more tedious (IE: hidden behind multiple dropdowns, when even a single dropdown isn't necessary) it either has something to do with the "AI" bubble, or far too much focus being put on touch screen devices (even then, it is not good for touch screen devices either) I have been disappointed to see that Firefox, ProtonDrive, Ubuntu, GNOME, and GitHub all face this issue

@seanpm2001 (sometime in late 2025)

Proton Lumo AI, something I have been waiting for for a long time (a fully open source AI that is privacy friendly)

Still do not intend to use yet, AI and human intelligence should not mix with my work for the time being
