In the future, I plan to have a self-hosted version of my works as well. I plan to still retain accounts on GitHub, Mastodon, and other sites. Currently, I am having difficulties in researching and funding a proper Linux server, it is an area of active research. I plan to have 2 websites, one for personal work, and one for public work (both will be public facing websites) with many subdomains.
