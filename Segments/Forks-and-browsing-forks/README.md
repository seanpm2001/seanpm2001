## [üç¥Ô∏è Forks and browsing forks](#-Forks-and-browsing-forks)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I fork projects I come across. I have plans to create a giant collection of forked repositories as a reference. Forks are given a special naming pattern to differentiate them from other repositories.

[:octocat: `Fork style guide`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001_Fork_Style-Guide/)

I already created a `Fork` section, I may need to merge this section into it in the future.
