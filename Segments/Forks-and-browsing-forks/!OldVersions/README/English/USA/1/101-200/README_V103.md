### [üç¥Ô∏è Forks and browsing forks](#-Forks-and-browsing-forks)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I fork projects I come across. I have plans to create a giant collection of forked repositories as a reference. Forks are given a special naming pattern to differentiate them from other repositories.

[:octocat: `Fork style guide`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001_Fork_Style-Guide/)

I already created a `Fork` section, I may need to merge this section into it in the future.

On 2025, July 11th, I began to approach a limit on GitHub. Due to poor wording prior to clicking the link, I became panicked, as I thought the repository limit was 50,000. It is actually 100,000. I had to shift my operations, and began to use my [:octocat: `alt account`](https://github.com/seanwallawalla/) to do the forks I typically do on my main account. On July 12th, I did 79 forks to this account, to even out the number, and have been doing 50 forks each day since, although I eventually plan to slow down to 10 per day. At my current rate, I expect to reach the repository limit on both accounts on **2039, Sunday, March 20th** by which time, I hope the repository limit is raised (so that I can continue to fully maintain my projects here) but I also plan to be independent from GitHub (although I will still maintain a mirror here)
