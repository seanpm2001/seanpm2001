### [❔️ Why is Python your favorite programming language?](#-Why-is-Python-your-favorite-programming-language-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

See below for the full store. I was a big user of Scratch, and eventually got into real programming after transitioning to Python in my first AP computer science class. I really came to love Python, and I have the most knowledge in it out of other programming languages (markdown and markup languages (like HTML or Markdown) are not included in this summary)

### [❔️ What got you into programming?](#-What-got-you-into-programming-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

In 2015, I was switched from an incorrect class to a class I was supposed to be in, which changed my life completely: my 2015 Middle School computer programming class.

Although the class mainly just used Scratch, this is where my interest skyrocketed. I was a big user of Scratch, and eventually got into real programming after transitioning to Python in my first AP computer science class. I really came to love Python, and I have the most knowledge in it out of other programming languages (markdown and markup languages (like HTML or Markdown) are not included in this summary)

### [❔️ How well can you program in Java?](#-How-well-can-you-program-in-Java-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I took an AP Java class, but I was missing too many stepping stones to fully get it. I did get several concepts of it, and this class familiarized me with Java quite a bit, along with using IDEs (Eclipse) I am not too good at Java, but I can do some basic stuff, not just Hello World programs. I can't write an entire program in Java though, I feel like my knowledge of Java basics and intermediate is 2.8%

### [❔️ Why do you use so many different programming languages?](#-Why-do-you-use-so-many-different-programming-languages-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I have always been a linguist. I like the looks of all the different programming languages and their syntax. Also, some projects are dependant on some languages. When I create an IDE out of a language, I prefer to use that language to emulate that language.

### [❔️ Do you actually know all those languages?](#-Do-you-actually-know-all-those-languages-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I know a few, but can't do more than the very basics in most. Languages I am good at include Python, BASH/Shell, HTML5, JavaScript, and Java.

### [❔️ Why do you put so much info out?](#-Why-do-you-put-so-much-info-out-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I have had years of decisions on what info I put out and what I don't put out. All data put out is thought out for 30 minutes to 5 years beforehand.

### [❔️ Why do you have image projects? Doesn't that defeat the point of GitHub?](#-Why-do-you-have-image-projects-Doesn-t-that-defeat-the-point-of-GitHub-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

It does in a way, but I don't have any good image platforms. Since GitHub is a version control site, and I add in content besides images, it fits pretty well, other than proper image viewing without downloading the repository.

### [❔️ Why are so many projects of yours so underdeveloped?](#-Why-are-so-many-projects-of-yours-so-underdeveloped-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I joined GitHub with the goal of collaboration. I am still building a following, and hope to have developers contributing to these projects based on their interest level in the project. There are so many of them, as I have been going through and adding new ideas as they come up.

### [❔️ How are you profitable?](#-How-are-you-profitable)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I am not profitable yet, but I am working on it. Since I work in the FOSS industry, I rely on donations and sponsors. I will try to limit my usage of ads (and I will not make sketchy, crappy ads like Playrix's homescape, gardenscape, etc. ads, or ads like about 99.998% of the ads on Google Play)

### [❔️ Why did you switch to Linux?](#-Why-did-you-switch-to-Linux-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

Linux is great. I have had a really, really horrible experience with Windows 10, there is too much to get into. I intended to start with Fedora Linux, but I had to go with Ubuntu 20.04, as I feared that I might void my laptops warranty (which I don't want to do, since this laptop costs over $1.4K)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I have been trying to gain followers on GitHub so that I eventually get someone to help interact with me on my projects. It has been a very slow process.

I got my account suspended 3 days later, and along with other reasons, I decided not to do this again. All I had to do to unsuspend my account was re-verify my email address.

### [❔️ Why do you have so many tabs open?]#-Why-do-you-have-so-many-tabs-open-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I have a lot of different projects. I have to manage lots of different projects. I have over 70 different Firefox profiles, each one containing their own set of tabs, however I only keep 1-3 profiles open at once. I close out of these when I finish with them for now.

### [❔️ Why do you use Wikipedia so much?](#-Why-do-you-use-Wikipedia-so-much-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

Wikipedia is one of my most used sites, GitHub is second. I find Wikipedia to be a great resource, and good for researching programming, chemistry, history, and more. I intend to start donating money to Wikipedia monthly some day.

### [❔️ Why do you play so many different games?](#Why-do-you-play-so-many-different-games-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I like to have balance in my life, and have periods to relax from programming. I come up with new ideas during this time period as well, and do other things, such as chores around the house.

### [❔️ Why do you play kids games?](#Why-do-you-play-kids-games-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I play games that have a general target of kids, but are also just past-time games. Examples include Restaurant/Bakery/Pet Shop/Fashion/Farm/City story, and Merge Plane. These games can be for both kids and adults. I played these games in my childhood, and have nostalgic ties to them. Some of them are just genuinely fun to begin with.

### [❔️ Why do you hate Google so much?](#-Why-do-you-hate-Google-so-much-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

Google has a long history of privacy invasion, hypocrasy, being a monopoly, killing off parts of the Internet, and more. I turned against Google in 2018.

### [❔️ Why do some of your projects use Go, Dart, or Flutter when you hate Google?](#-Why-do-some-of-your-projects-use-Go-Dart-or-Flutter-when-you-hate-Google-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

I don't write the entire project in this language, and in the cases I do, it is required for archiving the data and making an IDE (SNU_2D_Programming_Tools) or just a general pun. The 1 project that uses it but is using a degoogled version [(Candroid)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid)

Also, a few projects are written in Go! (a language that came out over 4 years before Go) its creator got steamrolled and no-one ever really looks at his language due to Googles claim that Go! won't be confused with Go, and that "lots of other projects and languages have the same name" which is not true, Google. You steamrolled him.

Since Go! (2004) and Go (2008/2009) both use the .go file extension, GitHub's lingust feature identifies it as Go instead of Go! Both languages vary significantly in Syntax.

### [❔️ what's with all of the Emojis?](#-What-s-with-all-of-the-Emojis-)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the answer]</b></p></summary>

On my GitHub profile page, I am using Emojis for navigation, and design purposes. I am trying to make use of almost every Emoji (or as many as possible) in a unique way.

On my other projects, they are done for the same purposes.
