I actively fork repositories on GitHub to act as an archive of repositories I have come across, and less often, repositories that I actively use. There is a problem that started with GitHub around 2022 regarding forks that I don't like:

Previously, if the account of a fork got suspended/deleted, you could still see "forked from johndoe/myrepository" at the top of the screen. It would be a dead link, but it would at least attribute the user. Nowadays, when this happens, the forked repository is instead turned into a source repository, which makes the suggestion that I created this repository, and it really messes with my timeline.
