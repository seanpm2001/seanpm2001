## [üõéÔ∏è How to reach me](#-How-to-reach-me)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I am most active on Mastodon, GitHub, and email. You can find more information below.

This section can also be viewed [`here`](/Segments/How-to-reach-me/README.md)

## [üÜîÔ∏è Online Identity](#-Online-Identity)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

**Formerly known as** `Identity theft` (renamed to `Online identity` on 2024, April 8th)

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted (in early 2022, I also destroyed the SIM/SD slot in my phone due to overuse, so there is no way to fix this now) Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)
* Through Discord (`Seanpm2001-GitHub` server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

**Discord user links:**

> * `SeanWallaWalla#1709` (my original Discord account)
> * `seanpm2001#4906` (my newest Discord account)

**Context:**

<img src="/Graphics/Social-Media/Discord/Screenclips/Discord_2022.06.21_seanpm_seanpm2001.png" alt="Discord image failed to load" title="Identity theft in progress (on Discord)" width="338" height="78">

On 2022, June 21st, someone joined my Discord server with a username incredibly similar to my own. I had to claim the `seanpm2001` username to prevent an imposter from forming.

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/) - currently inactive on the subreddit, but I will likely respond to a reply or DM within 48 hours

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me

You can find more info on my personal Gist. [Click/tap here to learn more about me](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/7e40a0e13c066a57577d8200b1afc6a3)

To avoid possible imposters, I will link to all the services I use here.

This section is actively being remodeled. It can also be viewed [here instead](/Segments/Online-Identity/README.md)

### [üìßÔ∏è Email information](#-Email-information)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

On 2022 Friday, January 7th, I created my first public email address. I may not be active here, but I will try to be here. The email address will be used for a mailing list.

The current public email address is [seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com](mailto:seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)

The email address is for professional use, and is tied to my GitHub developer program membership. It is to be used for serious inqueries and security reports. It is NOT to be used for conversation, advertising, notifications, or spam. If you wish to chat, I have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ) here, and I plan to have a more privacy friendly platform for communication in the near future.

Note: this email address is NOT a mailing list, it is just named like that. The name was inspired by the Linux Kernel Mailing List.

### [ü™ßÔ∏è Projects on other platforms](#-Projects-on-other-platforms)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have been using GitHub for software development since May 25th 2020, but I have been programming since early 2016.

On December 21st 2020, I created accounts on SourceForge, GitLab, and BitBucket. I currently don't maintain any projects there at the moment, GitHub still is the powerhouse.

- [`SourceForge link`](https://sourceforge.net/u/seanpm2001/profile/)
- [`GitLab link`](https://gitlab.com/seanpm2001/)
- [`BitBucket link`](https://bitbucket.org/seanpm2001/)

When I joined GitHub, I also intended to use other platforms as well, as something could always go wrong with my account or GitHub itself, and it isn't smart to rely on a single source for everything.

Now, if GitHub is having problems or if you have problems with GitHub, my projects are viewable on 3 other platforms. Unfortunately, they are still only on GitHub, as I don't have enough developers to manage 4 platforms at once, I will eventually mirror my projects over.
