Starting in 2021, I have grown a strong interest in Cartography. I read multiple maps per day, and use this skill to also improve my geography knowledge. I am most skilled in European maps, although I am really good with North America and Antarctica maps, and have very good knowledge with African and Asian maps. Oceania maps are something I am working on improving knowledge on.

It is getting to the point where I can identify areas on maps without even looking at a map with the international boundaries. European countries I am capable of doing this with include Portugal, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourgh, Sweden, Finland, and Ukraine. The other countries I am still memorizing.
