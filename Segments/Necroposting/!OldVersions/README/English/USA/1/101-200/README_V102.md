## [ü™¶Ô∏è Necroposting](#-Necroposting)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

My projects are given a longer life cycle than other projects, and because I maintain so many, it is hard to get to entries in time. Therefore, I encourage necroposting on projects, even if they haven't been touched in 4 years. They will be activated again once interest is shown in them. They are not completely dead (except for projects that have been [:octocat: `archived`](https://github.com/seanpm2001?tab=repositories&q=&type=archived&language=&sort=))
