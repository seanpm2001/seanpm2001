I signed up for the GitHub sponsors program on 2025, August 9th, and was approved on 2025, August 12th. I have temporarily cut other donation methods in favor of GitHub Sponsors, although cryptocurrency is still supported. My sponsor profile can be viewed [:octocat: `here`](https://github.com/sponsors/seanpm2001/)
