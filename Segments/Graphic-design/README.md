I am an entry-level graphic designer with a large preference for skeumorphism and 3D design with gradients and patterns. I have taken a few graphic design classes and can create computer graphics using GIMP, MS-PAINT, Blender 2.79, InkScape, Adobe PhotoShop CS6, 2015, CC 2017, Adobe Animate CS6, 2015, CC 2017, Adobe InDesign CC 2017, Adobe Illustrator CC 2017, BYOB 1.x, and Scratch 2.
