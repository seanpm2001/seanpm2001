### [üéìÔ∏è Education](#-Education)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have completed primary (pre-school, Elementary School) and secondary education (Middle School, High School) I have not yet attempted tertiary education (College/University) because I feel it is too expensive in the US and wouldn't suit me well. I would like to push for a PhD, but I would have to move to Germany, France, Wales, Finland, Sweden, or Switzerland to do so. I am still working on my portfolio too.
