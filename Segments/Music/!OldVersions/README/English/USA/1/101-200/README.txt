#### [üé∂Ô∏è Music](#-Music)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have a strong interest in music. I keep a collection of all of the songs I have ever listened to, with almost 99.8% accuracy. The majority of it is video game music.

I keep a copy of the shell of the database on GitHub, while most files aren't capable of being uploaded due to size limits and legal restrictions.

I have an inactive Bandcamp account as well [`@SeanWallaWallaFan`](https://bandcamp.com/seanwallawallafan)
