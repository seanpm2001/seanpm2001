I plan to have a media server in the future. I am currently in the process of setting it up, and getting help setting it up.

Right now, the "server" is just 10 external hard drives. It needs a lot of work.

Hard drive capacity: 55 terabytes (along with additional internal hard drives, totaling 8 terabytes, 63 terabytes total)
