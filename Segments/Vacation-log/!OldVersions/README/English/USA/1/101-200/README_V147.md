| Date range | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 2025.08.29 - 2025.08.31 | I will be on vacation at Cannon Beach for a few days, and won't be doing as much work. Most work has been paused during this time. I still have to maintain a small amount of commits per day, in order to keep my streak going. |
