| 🆕️ Next vacation | Next upcoming vacation not yet planned. |
| ☑️ 2025.08.29 - 2025.09.01 | I will be on vacation at Cannon Beach for a few days, and won't be doing as much work. Most work has been paused during this time. I still have to maintain a small amount of commits per day, in order to keep my streak going. (UPDATE 2025, August 22nd: There was a miscommunication. I am staying 3 nights, NOT 3 days. I will return on 2025, September 1st, and resume normal work 2025, September 2nd) |
