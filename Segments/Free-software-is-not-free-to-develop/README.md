Remember that free software and open source software is not always free to develop. Make sure to donate to software organizations you like, so that they can keep producing contributions to society.

My list of supported organizations include:

* Wikimedia (creators of Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and more)
* VideoLan (creators of VLC Media Player and other prominent video tools)
* GNU
* The Free Software Foundation
* The Open Document foundation
* Khan Academy
* The Linux foundation
* FFMPEG
* The Internet Archive (also the creators of the wayback machine)
* Open Street Map
* Inkscape
* Mozilla (moz://a)
* FreeCodeCamp
* Mastodon

**More to be listed**
