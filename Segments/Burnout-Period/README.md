|---|
| You have likely noticed that my commit activity is down heavily lately (starting on 2025, November 24th, and intensifying on 2025, December 30th) it is currently the worst it has ever been. I am going through burnout, and currently struggling with all of my projects. |
| I am currently trying to recover, it is going to take a lot of time and effort to bring operations back to normal. |
| My current focuses are keeping caught up on a small set of projects, while I attempt to get caught up on my journal. |
