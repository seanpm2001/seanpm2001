<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have several upcoming projects that I currently can only list the abbreviations for:

- CU
- FaTT
- FFDRY
- G---2001
- N2O
- NG2001
- W1
- W2
- ZS
- NNA
- MGV

They are currently private. I normally don't keep projects private for this long, but I have special reasons for this.
