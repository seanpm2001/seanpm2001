| ❓ SECRET PROJECT ❓ |
|---|
| 🖨️ Printer revolution ✊  |

I am developing a printer project in secret, and am looking for developers and funding. The software will be free and open source, while the hardware will cost money (although blueprints will be open source) I feel it is unethical to sell software, and that it is ethical to sell hardware.

**Special bundled software:**

- Cura UltiMaker
- Blender
- CUPS
- MainSail
- Klipper
- MarlinFirmware
- Linux kernel
- Fluidd
- Slic3r
- Moonraker

**Promises:**

- Guaranteed privacy (no telemetry, no tracking, no backdoors)
- No DRM (Digital Restrictive Measures)
- No Vender Lock-in
- No planned obsolescence
- Always free (software)
- Always open source (software and hardware)
- No restrictions (on what you can print, even if what you printed is considered illegal (it is **your** printing press, you are free to do what you want with it, and it is solely your responsibility. Since there isn't any tracking, there is no way to tell what you printed, and no way to report it))
- Right to repair guaranteed
- Hardware longevity
- Software longevity
- Guaranteed ink cartridge compatibility
- The purchaser of the printer is the owner of the printer (it is not Hardware as a Service Substitute (HaaSS) nor is it Software as a Service Substitute (SaaSS))

_More information will be given out at a later time._

**Funding goal:** `$2040.25` (ref1) **/** `$72000.00` (ref2) _(goal2 ($72k) in 2024.12.31 US Dollars)_

- - (ref1) in modern currency (including inflation)
- - (ref2) in 2024, December 31st currency value

**Goal tiers**

- $30,000.00 - More information will be released
- $50,000.00 - Blueprints will be released (once ready)
- $72,000.00 - All info will go public, manufacturing will start for a select group
- $85,000.00 - Permanent monthly sponsorship ($10 per month, per user/organization) for several printer projects (which include: OctoPrint, MainSail-Crew, Fluidd-Core, MarlinFirmware, UltiMaker, tobbelobb, Blender foundation, and more)

Funds will go towards developing hardware, and paying programmers and engineers. A production center is needed, and a valid blueprint is needed as well.

I have an old Epson printer to use for design reference (it is broken down)
