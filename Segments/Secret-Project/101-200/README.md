| ❓ SECRET PROJECT ❓ |
|---|
| 🖨️ Printer revolution ✊  |

I am developing a printer project in secret, and am looking for developers and funding. The software will be free and open source, while the hardware will cost money (although blueprints will be open source) I feel it is unethical to sell software, and that it is ethical to sell hardware.

**Special bundled software:**

- Cura UltiMaker
- Blender
- CUPS
- MainSail
- Klipper
- MarlinFirmware
- Linux kernel
- Fluidd
- Slic3r
- Moonraker

**Promises:**

- Guaranteed privacy
- No DRM
- No Vender Lock-in
- No planned obsolescence
- Always free (software)
- Always open source (software and hardware)
- No restrictions (on what you can print)
- Right to repair guaranteed
- Hardware longevity
- Software longevity
- Guaranteed ink cartridge compatibility

_More information will be given out at a later time._

**Funding goal:** `$2040` **/** `$72000` _(goal2 ($72k) in 2025.12.31 US Dollars)_

**Goal tiers**

- $30,000.00 - More information will be released
- $50,000.00 - Blueprints will be released (once ready)
- $72,000.00 - All info will go public, manufacturing will start for a select group
- $85,000.00 - Permanent monthly sponsorship ($10 per month, per user/organization) for several printer projects (which include: OctoPrint, MainSail-Crew, Fluidd-Core, MarlinFirmware, UltiMaker, tobbelobb, Blender foundation, and more)

Funds will go towards developing hardware, and paying programmers and engineers. A production center is needed, and a valid blueprint is needed as well.

I have an old Epson printer to use for design reference (it is broken down)
