I am an avid video game player, playing various video games to pass time, relax, have fun, and come up with new ideas. I am also a card game player, but I need extra help playing most card games due to a learning curve and limited knowledge on card games.

Lately, I mainly play mobile games, but from time to time, I will use a video game console, or RetroPie on my Raspberry Pi.
