<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Some of my repositories are temporarily private, as they are completely unready to be seen. I have to resolve some issues before I can release them. Information on which projects are private can be found through my [:octocat: `REDACTED`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/REDACTED/) repository.

As of 2025, Sunday, January 5th, I have 181 private repositories.
