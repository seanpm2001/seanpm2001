I am in the process of remodeling my GitHub profile page. Remodeling started on 2024, Saturday March 23rd. Here are my current goals

- **Note to self:** _Feel free to add more entries whenever necessary_
- **Note to self:** _This should be a daily project. Try to accomplish at least 3 things per day, and remember that you have until 2024, May 25th to finish (64 day deadline, 5 days down, as of 2024, Wednesday, March 27th)_
