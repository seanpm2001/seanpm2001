I am in the process of remodeling my GitHub profile page. Since I am not actively working on it, this may take a while. Remodeling started on 2024, Saturday March 23rd. I will not be implementing them today, as I am just brainstorming ideas for now. Here are my current goals

**Note to self:** _Feel free to add more entries whenever necessary_
