I am in the process of remodeling my GitHub profile page. Remodeling started on 2024, Saturday March 23rd. I expect to release the final version of the 4 year anniversary update on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. Here are my current goals:

- **Note to self:** _Feel free to add more entries whenever necessary_
- **Note to self:** _This should be a daily project. Try to accomplish at least 3 things per day, and remember that you have until 2024, May 25th to finish (64 day deadline, 7 days down, as of 2024, Friday, March 29th)_
