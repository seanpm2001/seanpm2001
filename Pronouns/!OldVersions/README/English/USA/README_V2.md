# Pronouns

## 2023

**2023, Thursday, August 17th at 02:56 pm PST**

GitHub added the ability to add pronouns to your profile in mid-2023, and I decided to fill in the information like so:

<!-- The original 5 options !-->

- [ ] Don't specify
- [ ] they/them
- [ ] she/her
- [x] he/him
- [ ] Custom

## 2025

**2025, Friday, August 1st at 08:48 pm PST**

- [ ] Don't specify
- [ ] they/them
- [ ] she/her
- [ ] he/him
- [x] Custom

> he/him & programmer/developer (not: coder)
