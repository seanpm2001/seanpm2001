This is a timeline of my social links on GitHub. Starting with the creation of my account, I linked the then-abandoned Twitter account to my GitHub account (the account was still abandoned during the entire time it was displayed, and still is, as of 2023, Sunday, August 13th)

On 2023, February 3rd, I found that Mastodon can be linked on GitHub with a unique icon. I have been trying to join Mastodon for a while, this spurred me towards creating my account. The Twitter link was removed, as it has been abandoned since 2018, and also because Twitter ownership has caused the site to severely decline.

As of 2023, February 4th, I am considering adding links to my Reddit account, and my alternative GitHub account, and possibly my Discord server.

On 2023, Sunday, August 13th, as part of updating my GitHub profile further, I added 2 social links. These new links currently don't have custom icons, but are relevant for inclusion.

## 2026, January 1st — Present

On 2026, Tuesday, January 1st, I removed the Khan Academy link, and added a link to my MicroNations Wiki user page, as I stopped using Khan Academy before 2023, and felt that this one was more relevant, as I am founding a micronation codenamed RON/NNA (the actual name is currently private)

This update was made 30 days late, as I have been struggling with burnout, and am gradually (but very, very slowly) regaining control of my projects.
