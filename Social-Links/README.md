This is a timeline of my social links on GitHub. Starting with the creation of my account, I linked the then-abandoned Twitter account to my GitHub account (the account was still abandoned during the entire time it was displayed, and still is, as of 2023, February 4th)

On 2023, February 3rd, I found that Mastodon can be linked on GitHub with a unique icon. I have been trying to join Mastodon for a while, this spurred me towards creating my account. The Twitter link was removed, as it has been abandoned since 2018, and also because Twitter ownership has caused the site to severely decline.

As of 2023, February 4th, I am considering adding links to my Reddit account, and my alternative GitHub account, and possibly my Discord server.
