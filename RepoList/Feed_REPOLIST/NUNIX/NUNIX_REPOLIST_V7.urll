//// Old, outdated notes (2023, Monday, May 22nd to 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd)

//// A revival of this project started on 2023, Monday, May 22nd. It is expected to continue consecutively for one more day before new repositories go on hiatus again.
//// The next revival will start on 2023, June 22nd.

//// The first note was correct, the second note became inaccurate due to several schedule changes between May and July. A brief revival started from 2023, July 5th to 2023, July 6th. There were a couple more planned for 2023 July, but my schedule was thrown off multiple times.
