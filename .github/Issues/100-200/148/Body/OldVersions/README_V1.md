### Description

The 4 year anniversary update was well over a year ago, and is no longer needed in the main README (archives are the best place for it) it is also taking up a lot of memory on the README. It needs to be removed. The following elements should be removed:

- [ ] Daily logs regarding the remodel,
- [ ] Remodel in progress section
- [ ] Remodel goals section
- [ ] Remodel history section
