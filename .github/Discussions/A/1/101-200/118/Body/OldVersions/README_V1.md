# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 47, 2024, Tuesday, May 7th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.07`

**Released on:** `2024, Tuesday, May 7th at 10:45 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 467h version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the forty-fifth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published later in the day, written and published after 10:30 pm. This was the most minimal update in the series of 65 updates, as I spent less than 20 minutes on the update. I have been having trouble keeping up with other projects, notably with my journal today. This project is now on the edge of failure. I still have 18 days to accomplish the last 9 goals, but very little progress has been made in the last 3 updates.
