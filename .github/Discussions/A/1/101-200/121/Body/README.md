# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 50, 2024, Friday, May 10th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.10`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, May 10th at 06:54 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 50th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the forty-eighth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I spent a lot of time on this project today, and accomplished 3 goals. Todays update was published much earlier in the day, and contains new graphics as well.
