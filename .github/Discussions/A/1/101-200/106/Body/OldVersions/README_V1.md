# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 35, 2024, Thursday, April 25th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.25`

**Released on:** `2024, Thursday, April 25th at 10:44 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 35th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-third beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Small changes were made again today, as I had less time. Not much is required for some updates, it is a profile, after all. Today, a raster version of a bitmap image was added, and most remaining Markdown styled links were replaced with HTML styled links, with 9 exceptions.

I am still also in the planning phase of a major update (involving my system setup)
