# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 64, 2024, Friday, May 24th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.24`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, May 24th at 08:20 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 64th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created tomorrow on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the sixty-second beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created solely on 2024, Friday, May 24th, and is the last beta update in the 4 Year Anniversary Update.

This is the final beta release in the 4 year anniversary update. This update will be finalized tomorrow. This update was done quickly, as there wasn't much I could do to wrap up work on the current setup section (the last goal) I feel I have ended with a bang, and not a whimper, as my profile transformed completely since the start of this update cycle. Further updates to this section can be done over time, or through the SeansOSData project. This update is now complete.
