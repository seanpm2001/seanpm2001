# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 41, 2024, Wednesday, May 1st)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.01`

**Released on:** `2024, Wednesday, May 1st at 08:50 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 41st version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-ninth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published earlier in the day, and written even earlier. Today, the first update for 2024 May was created. There are only 24 more days left to work on this update. I made significant progress today, especially on most of the remaining goals, where I found several were already completed, but not listed as so. I took on additional goals on top of this. 1 segment was updated, and 1 new segment was added. More work was done per segment.
