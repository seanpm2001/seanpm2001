# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 62, 2024, Wednesday, May 22nd)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.22`

**Released on:** `2024, Wednesday, May 22nd at 07:31 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 62nd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the sixtieth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created from 2024, Tuesday, May 21st to 2024, Wednesday, May 22nd, and is one of the last 5 updates in the 4 Year Anniversary Update. Maintenance was done today, mostly working to reduce the file size. There are still 2 more days for me to finish the final goal, and I plan to go slowly, as it isn't a hard goal to implement. I fixed the README overflow issue, and established the top test zone as its own distinct section.
