**Tag:** `V2024.05.03`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, May 3rd at 04:18 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 43rd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the forty-first beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published earlier in the day, written and published in the mid to late afternoon. 2 goals were accomplished today, 1 appeared to have already been done. The README had a significant update, where the profile body was split into 2 sections: one for the @seanpm2001 account, and one for the @seanwallawalla account, and 5 new sections were added for this account section. Besides this, not much else was done in this update.
