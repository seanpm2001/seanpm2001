# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 38, 2024, Sunday, April 28th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.28`

**Released on:** `2024, Sunday, April 28th at 11:16 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 378h version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-sixth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published much later in the day. I have been setbacks today. Today, some new media was added, some sections were modified, and the groundwork for the major system setup update started to get laid.
