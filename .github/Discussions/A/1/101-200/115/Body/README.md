# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 44, 2024, Saturday, May 4th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.04`

**Released on:** `2024, Saturday, May 4th at 05:57 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 44th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the forty-second beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published later in the day, written and published in the early evening. This was a small maintenance update, where no new goals were worked on. Some sections were improved, and I did an experimental update to the index to add a light HTML table style to the classic style list. The test was a success. I observed it in another users profile, and added it to mine.
