# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 42, 2024, Thursday, May 2nd)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.02`

**Released on:** `2024, Thursday, May 2nd at 08:42 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 42nd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fortieth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published later in the day, and written later than yesterday (yesterday, work was started in the morning. Today, work was started in the evening) there were 3 goals I was hoping to get accomplished today, but after stretching my time thin, I could only get one accomplished. There are still only a small amount (11) goals to complete before the 2024 May 25th deadline (in 23 days) so I might need to add more goals. I don't know how I will get the timing right (completing the last goal on the last day)
