# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 63, 2024, Thursday, May 23rd) (1 day late)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.23`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, May 24th at 08:00 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 63rd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created tomorrow on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the sixty-first beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created from 2024, Wednesday, May 22nd to 2024, Friday, May 24th (although 2024, Thursday, May 23rd was skipped entirely) and is one of the last 5 updates in the 4 Year Anniversary Update. This update came a day late, as I struggled with focus last night. This is a filler update. The next update will be the last one in the 4 year anniversary update with additions.
