# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 30, 2024, Saturday, April 20th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.20`

**Released on:** `2024, Saturday, April 20th at 07:20 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 30th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twenty-eighth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

The project is feeling a lot closer to completion. A lot of time was spent today separating segment sections and creating hard copies of them. Experiments were also done with YAML FrontMatter.
