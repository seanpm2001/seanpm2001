# 4 year anniversary update

**Tag:** `V2024.05.25`

**Released on:** `2024, Saturday, May 25th at 12:17 pm PST`

This is the full release of the 4 year anniversary update, and is the 65th version of the 4 year anniversary update series. This is the sixty-third beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created from 2024, Friday, May 24th to 2024, Saturday, May 25th, and is the last update in the 4 Year Anniversary Update. It focuses on tidying up and finalizing the update.

This project will still be updated, albeit not as frequently. I plan to take a break from this repository for a minimum of 1 week now. I don't plan to do anything like this again here.
