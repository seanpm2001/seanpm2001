# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 39, 2024, Monday, April 29th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.29`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, April 29th at 11:45 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 39th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-seventh beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published much later in the day, way too close to midnight. I have been setbacks today, taking on some structural projects (tab organization, file sorting, note work, and lots of distractions) Today, some a lot of new media was added, some sections were briefly modified, but not much was done. This was a rushed update due to how little time I had. I hope to do more for tomorrows update, which will be the final update of 2024, April.
