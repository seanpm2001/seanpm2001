# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 24, 2024, Sunday, April 14th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.14`

**Released on:** `2024, Saturday, April 13th at 10:39 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 24th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twenty-second beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update came very late again, and not much was accomplished, similar to yesterdays update. I didn't have as much time for the project due to a lot of distracted downtime today.

A new vCard is included in this update.
