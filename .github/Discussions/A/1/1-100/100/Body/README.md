# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 29, 2024, Friday, April 19th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.19`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, April 19th at 08:30 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 29th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twenty-seventh beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was done earlier in the day, but I had a 10+ minute delay on publishing the release, as I began working on tommorows update. Todays update contains major changes to document formatting, with hundreds of headings modified to make the page look better and be easier to navigate.
