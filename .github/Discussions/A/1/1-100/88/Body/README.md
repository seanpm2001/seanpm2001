# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 17, 2024, Sunday, April 7th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.07`

**Released on:** `2024, Sunday, April 7th at 03:11 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 17th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fifteenth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I am putting so much work into each update that it becomes very tempting to release prematurely. I am limiting myself to one release per day.
