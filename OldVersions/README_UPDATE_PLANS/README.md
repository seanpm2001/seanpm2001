Computer user type

- [ ] Low usage - I use the computer very infrequently

- [ ] Novice - I use the computer sometimes

- [ ] Average - I use the computer at an average usage

- [ ] Savvy - I use the computer in a Savvy way

- [ ] Power user - I use the computer heavily, but not in a savvy way

- [x] Power user + savvy - I am the type of computer user who uses the computer constantly (over 8 hours per day) and I am extremely tech savvy and experienced. I also use the computer and push it to its very limits at all times of day, wearing down even the most durable computers in less than a year.

Education

I have completed primary (pre-school, Elementary School) and secondary education (Middle School, High School) I have not yet attempted tertiary education (College/University) because I feel it is too expensive in the US and wouldn't suit me well. I would like to push for a PhD, but I would have to move to Germany, France, Wales, Finland, Sweden, or Switzerland to do so. I am still working on my portfolio too.
