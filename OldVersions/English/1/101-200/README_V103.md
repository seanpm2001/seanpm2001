|---|
| **This issue started with beta 14 of the 4 year anniversary update, and was fixed with beta 15** |

- [2024.04.04] On 2024, Thursday, April 4th, the document surpassed 500 kilobytes in size. The file no longer is previewable on GitHub while editing, making debugging a lot harder. This document is close to reaching the GitHub 524.288 kilobyte size limit, so the bottom segments of the page may no longer load.
- [2024.04.05] The amount has dropped down with the 2024, Friday, April 5th update, but I still can't get the document to render now
- [2024.04.06] The file is back to normal standing, and the rendering issue has been fixed. I am still working on keeping the file under 524,289 bytes
- [2024.04.07] Something may need to be done with the `What I'm currently working on§Major projects` section, as it is the biggest part of this file, yet it can't be shrunk easily. I am still working on keeping the file under 524,289 bytes
- [2024.04.08] Size wasn't as much of a concern today, but I am still being cautious
- [2024.04.09] Size is becoming a concern again, as I have less than 10% capacity for new content here. Also, the file is over 10,000 lines long again.
- [2024.04.10] Size is now a major concern, as I have less than 5% capacity for new content now.
- [2024.04.11] Reaching critical mass. Parts of the bottom of the file may not render if the size continues to grow without control.
- [2024.04.12] The file hit its size limit today, so I moved the `What I'm currently working on` section out into a separate page, which saves 209,975 bytes (209.97 kilobytes) nearly 40% of the document. Issues with size should not recur again for some time.
- [2024.04.13] -> [2024.04.16] No updates for this date.
- [2024.04.17] No concerns about the file size were present today, but the file did drop nearly 100 kilobytes in size today with the removal of the file history 
for versions 1 to 100 (these versions are now present only in older versions
- [2024.04.18] -> [2024.04.19] No updates for this date.

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, over 25 translations are out of date and are using Version 8 or Version 9 of this README file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 1st 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

🎌️ **Flag guide** 🎌️

🚩️🏴️🏳️ Flags were beginning to get added in version 2 of this document. I was originally just going to add the Ukraine 🇺🇦️ flag, but decided to add more, until every language had at least 1 flag. They were done purely with the existing knowledge of the developer. In version 3, flags were added for every language. There are some notes that go with this:

🌐️ **[Unions `🇪🇺️` and Nations `🇺🇳️`]** 🌐️

Languages listed here that are official languages of the European Union have a European Union flag `🇪🇺️` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 27 languages recognized by the European Union, from 27 different member states.

Languages listed here that are official languages of the United Nations have a United Nations flag `🇺🇳️` next to them. As of 2022 March 14th, there are currently 6 languages recognized by the European Union (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish) alongside 193 different member states and 2 observer states.

🌏️ **[One China (PRC) `🇨🇳️` Two China (Taiwan) `🇹🇼️` Hong Kong `🇭🇰️` and Macau `🇲🇴️`]** 🌏️

For neutrality reasons, languages listed here that have an official majority in Chinese speakers will receive all 4 of these flags, even if the language isn't Chinese or in the Sino family of languages.

🌐️ **[Global languages `🌐️`]** 🌐️

Currently, 1 global language is listed, and that is Esperanto. Esperanto is not native to any countries, its goal is to be a universal _lingua franca_ (Latin translation: _bridge language_) it is represented with a `globe with meridians` or `🌐️`

💞️ **[Regarding sexuality 🏳️‍🌈️]** 💞️

Sexuality is not measured here, I feel it would be unnecessary, as you are picking out a language, not a sexuality.

💠️ **[Location of flag 🚩️]** 💠️

Flags are located at the end of each language name (after the Romanization) with one space before, to the right.

Like this:

**[Pl Polski Polish 🇵🇱️]**

But not like this:

**[Pl Polski 🇵🇱️ Polish]**

And also not like this:

**[Pl 🇵🇱️ Polski Polish]**

**2022.03.12**

I was so angry and frustrated. I didn't save the file, and my computer randomly froze up twice, then crashed. I had to re-add all the flags, it took an hour to do so originally, and I was just seconds away from finishing. I couldn't save the file quick enough. Luckily, all the research was still in my head, and there was no data that wasn't easily replacable (identically) so it is a type of important work that was the best thing to lose, since it was the easiest to recreate, taking me less than 20 minutes

**Other notes:**

- ⚠️ A language is missing: `Latvian`
- ℹ️ Possibly supporting the next 126 languages that are going to be added to Google Translate
- 🗜️ Plans to automate this process with the [`@AUTOMATE2001`](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001) bot
- ⛔️ Need to find a way to work with these languages on services other than Google Translate.
- ⚠️ There might be noticeable lag in this section due to how many flag emojis are in use.

[`Wikipedia summary`](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine&oldid=1215221241&useskin=monobook)

> On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II. It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory. From a population of 41 million in January 2022, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war, widely described as an ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.

### [🚀️ What I'm looking to collaborate on](#-What-I-m-looking-to-collaborate-on)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I currently need a technical job. I am willing to work on any ethical computer project, as long as it is written in a language I know well (Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, CSS, Lisp, Markdown, XML, Shell, or any/all of the ones listed)

<details><summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse further collaboration info]</summary>

***

Companies I refuse to work for include:

> Google

> Facebook

> Zoom technologies

> Spectrum Enterprise

> Clever

> No other companies currently listed

Companies I am currently considering include:

> Microsoft [::] - I have some family that works here, and I have had a long past with Microsoft (all the way back to 2005) even though I consider some things Microsoft does as unethical, I wouldn't mind working here (I have a very strong personal experience with Microsoft products, notably Windows XP) If there are any jobs here that use Python, I can do them.

> VideoLan /-\ - I would like to try and write documentation for VideoLan, I am very good at writing documentation, as I enjoy doing it, and I do it most of the day, every day. Currently, VideoLan is unable to have documentation writers due to low amounts of volunteers. If allowed, I will write documentation for every version of VLC that doesn't have it (only in English, I can't do other languages)

> Canonical (&) - I would like to try and contribute to Linux in any way I can. Working at Canonical is currently an option, I don't know exactly what I would do here, but I could hopefully do something.

> The KDE Foundation (K) - KDE would be a nice foundation to work for. I really love their super lightweight open source projects, and I could help reduce even more bloat. If a job is available in a language I have at least 40% knowledge in, I could work here.

> Khan Academy (^) - I would like to help contribute to Khan Academy, I have used the site for nearly 4 years straight on a daily basis. If it would be possible to make videos and articles for them, I have always considered starting a course on virtualization.

> The GNOME organization (G) - if possible, I could try and set some changes to reduce the huge memory usage of GNOME, that has always stuck out as something that needs to be fixed to me. It is still a lot better than Windows 10s memory usage, idle on Windows 10 would use half my RAM, no matter how much I had (4, 8, 16 GB) on my first Linux laptop, it has always stayed below 1.8 gigabytes when idle (also counting the system monitor)

> No other companies currently listed

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I will do free technical support for you, or programming related work in my scope of knowledge. I do this on my own time, so I can only help a certain amount of people a day. Before trying to ask for my technical support, try the following to troubleshoot:

> `CTRL` + `Z` - Undoes your last mistake

> Restart your computer

I charge money for technical support ($5.00 per hour) if I have to do these steps more than 3 times in a year for 1 person.

**Some limitations**

I cannot do projects unless the scripts are on GitHub or SourceForge already.

I also can't work on projects that are related to your school work. Please do not ask me to do your school work for you. We could both get in trouble for this.

I would prefer to help with projects written in Python 3, Markdown, HTML5, CSS3, Java, C, C++, or JavaScript. I won't be able to help as well with projects written in other languages.

No other limitations listed at the moment.

|---|
| Linguistics |

I have been a linguist since my early childhood. I jokingly changed my middle name to `language` in my early childhood, but I think it would fit as a 2nd middle name.

| <img src="/Graphics/Hobbies/Linguistics/Cyrillic_letter_Zhe_-_uppercase_and_lowercase.svg" alt="Original linguistics:Cyrillic profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it" title="Cyrillic text sample" width="100" height="100" align="right"> |
|---|
| Cyrillic Zhe sample Ж |

I like the look and sound of various languages, whether they are human spoken or machine instructions. Unfortunately, I can't write completely in a language other than English, Python, HTML, or markdown.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Georgian/Damts'erloba.svg" alt="Georgian language sample" title="Sample Georgian language text" width="695" height="154" align="left"> |
|---|
| Georgian language |

Georgian is an interesting language to me that expanded my interest in Linguistics around 2018-2019.

|---|
| Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs |

I have interest in hieroglyph languages, Ancient Egyptian was the first one I saw.

|---|
| Tifinagh alphabet (Berber languages) |

I like the aethetics of the Berber language, it was a highlight of mine in 2019. I used to play with the Windows character map looking at languages, and this was one that really caught my eye.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Japanese/Nihongo.svg" alt="Japanese language sample" title="Japanese language sample" width="200" height="448"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Chinese/Chineselanguage.svg" alt="Chinese language sample" title="Chinese language sample" width="350" height="568"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Korean/Hangugeo-Chosonmal.svg" alt="Korean language sample" title="Korean language sample" width="263" height="371"> |
|---|---|---|
| Japanese | Chinese | Korean |

I am easily able to tell the difference between the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean languages, although I can't read/write in them, and I only know how to say a handful of words in these languages.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Gothic/Wulfila_bibel.jpeg" alt="Gothic language sample" title="Gothic language sample" width="350" height="440" align="left"> |

| Gothic language |

One day, I was browsing Wiktionary, and I discovered the Gothic language. It has a really cool alphabet. My favorite letter in the Gothic alphabet is `𐌸`

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Greek/Greekalphabet.svg" alt="Greek alphabet" title="The Greek Alphabet" width="450" height="55" align="right"> |
|---|
| Greek language |

Greek is another interesting language. I am actively memorizing and researching the language.

|---|
| Icelandic alphabet |

Functionally speaking, if I were to use another language other than English as my preferred primary language, I would choose Icelandic. It is functional, and fits with me well.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Latin/Abecedarium_latinum_clasicum.svg" alt="Latin alphabet" title="The Latin Alphabet" width="438" height="168" align="left"> |
|---|
| Latin alphabet |

I know several Latin phrases, but, like most people, I speak a language that uses the Latin script, but not Latin itself. I also know that Latin has a lot more letters than what is typically seen, there are close to 500 Latin letters (when you account acutes, diacritics, and other letters)

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Ukrainian/Ukrainian_alphabet_in_capital_letters.svg" alt="Ukrainian alphabet" title="The Ukrainian alphabet" width="670" height="360" align="right"> |
|---|
| Ukrainian alphabet |

I have been trying to learn the Ukrainian language instead of the Russian language since 2022. I set a goal in 2023 to learn 1 Ukrainian word per day, but unfortunately, I stopped after about 40 days. Ukrainian is very mutually intelligible with the Belarusian and Russian languages.

Armenian is another unique looking language. I have yet to learn a single word in Armenian.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Arabic/Arabic_albayancalligraphy.svg" alt="Arabic calligraphy" title="Arabic sample" width="686" height="302" align="right"> |
|---|
| Arabic language |

I know some words in Arabic. It is a hard language for me to learn, as it contains a different script, and the writing direction is right to left, instead of left to right.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Cuneiform/Cuneiform_pictographic_signs_(vertical).jpeg" alt="Cuneiform text sample" title="Cuneiform text sample" width="567" height="513" align="left"> | <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Cuneiform/Xerxes_Cuneiform_Van.jpeg" alt="Cuneiform carving" title="Cuneiform carving" width="691" height="590"> |

| Cuneiform minor | Cuneiform major |

I learned how to write a little bit in Cuneiform. It isn't a skill I use very often, as it is not needed very much nowadays.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Hebrew/Alefbet_ivri.svg" alt="Hebrew text sample" title="Hebrew text sample" width="567" height="513" align="right"> |
|---|
| Hebrew language |

Hebrew is another right to left language, and has interesting simplicity in its writing system. I know few words in Hebrew.

| <img src="/Graphics/Linguistics/Mongolian/Monggol_kele.svg" alt="Mongolian text sample" title="Mongolian text sample" width="135" height="405" align="left"> |
|---|
| Classic Mongolian language |

Mongolian is a unique language, as it is written vertically, instead of horizontally. The modern version of the Mongolian language isn't as unique, as it just uses Cyrillic.

ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠬᠡᠯᠡ

Unfortunately, Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 by default don't support a font that supports the classic Mongolian lannguage.

| ⭐️ Overview |
|---|

I have a strong interest in linguistics, it doesn't matter the language, the writing system, the age, the history, etc. I just like learning about new languages. This interest also has expanded into programming languages. I divide it up like this:

| ✍️ Type | ℹ️ Sample |
|---|---|
| Human spoken languages | English |
| Programming language | Python |
| Markup language | HTML |

I am a history buff, with knowledge of history spanning back over 13.8 billion years ago (Big Bang) to the current day. I like to learn about history, and I have knowledge of a large assortment of eras and events, including extensive knowledge of things other than World War I or World War II (but I also still know a lot about the 2 world wars) for Earth history, my knowledge goes back to 8000 BCE in extensive detail, down to 27000 BCE in less detail, and mostly geological events before 27000 BCE. I like to learn all types of history, and not just the history of warfare.

I owe my interest in history to my first High School history teacher, who was really enthusiastic about what he was teaching, and was just a general awesome and nice history teacher. I would no doubt make him teacher of the year for that year of High School. Past history classes never got me too into the subject of history, but this one really opened my mind to history.

Pretty much anything, but mainly:

- Europe
- World War I
- World War II

I keep a daily journal. I have been on and off with this for most of my childhood, until sticking with it every day since September 26th 2016.

The journaling project is part of my life archive project, a digital archive of my entire life.

As of August 7th 2021, the main journal has over 7 million words. I average between 1358-2500/2500-3600/3600-13000 words per day (depending on what happens that day and how much I have to talk about)

I plan to publish the full journal on Tuesday, May 15th 2040. For now, certain related media, and certain templates are public, but several terabytes of data is private (the full journal takes up over 8 gigabytes of space, just for the journal, due to usage of images over a ~5 year period)

I have an inactive Bandcamp account as well [`@SeanWallaWallaFan`](https://bandcamp.com/seanwallawallafan)

### [🐧️ Linux](#-Linux)

<details><summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse my Linux story]</summary>

I was a fan of Windows up until Windows 10. I began to try to switch to Linux from 2018 to 2020. On July 9th 2020, I finally switched to Linux, getting my first Dell laptop with Linux pre-installed.

<img src="/Graphics/Photos/Linux/Laptop/20200709_124359.jpg" alt="Linux logo failed to load" title="Linux mascot" width="100" height="100">

My first full on Linux operating system (other than Android 1.6) is Ubuntu 20.04. I am a very proud Linux user, as I am no longer constrained my forced updates, proprietary software and licensing, lack of control and customization, the fear of instability, and other issues I had with Windows 10. As of March 4th 2021, I am still using Linux on a daily basis, but my fear of Blue Screens has not gone away, sometimes even fearing I got a blue screen when I know that isn't even technically possible on Ubuntu (unless you had software that mimicks it) I originally was going to install Fedora 32 on my laptop when I got it, but I decided to give Ubuntu a try first. So far, I have liked it, except for 2 things: Snaps being proprietary, and the ugliness of GNOME 3.x (compared to earlier versions and other desktop environments, like the one I wanted but haven't installed yet; KDE)

#### [🆔️ Online Identity](#-Online-Identity)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

**Formerly known as** `Identity theft` (renamed to `Online identity` on 2024, April 8th)

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted (in early 2022, I also destroyed the SIM/SD slot in my phone due to overuse, so there is no way to fix this now) Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)
* Through Discord (`Seanpm2001-GitHub` server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

**Discord user links:**

> * `SeanWallaWalla#1709` (my original Discord account)
> * `seanpm2001#4906` (my newest Discord account)

**Context:**

<img src="/Graphics/Social-Media/Discord/Screenclips/Discord_2022.06.21_seanpm_seanpm2001.png" alt="Discord image failed to load" title="Identity theft in progress (on Discord)" width="338" height="78">

On 2022, June 21st, someone joined my Discord server with a username incredibly similar to my own. I had to claim the `seanpm2001` username to prevent an imposter from forming.

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/) - currently inactive on the subreddit, but I will likely respond to a reply or DM within 48 hours

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me

You can find more info on my personal Gist. [Click/tap here to learn more about me](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/7e40a0e13c066a57577d8200b1afc6a3)

To avoid possible imposters, I will link to all the services I use here.

##### [📧️ Email information](#-Email-information)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

On 2022 Friday, January 7th, I created my first public email address. I may not be active here, but I will try to be here. The email address will be used for a mailing list.

The current public email address is [seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com](mailto:seanpm2001-mailing-list@protonmail.com)

The email address is for professional use, and is tied to my GitHub developer program membership. It is to be used for serious inqueries and security reports. It is NOT to be used for conversation, advertising, notifications, or spam. If you wish to chat, I have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ) here, and I plan to have a more privacy friendly platform for communication in the near future.

Note: this email address is NOT a mailing list, it is just named like that. The name was inspired by the Linux Kernel Mailing List.

##### [🇻 vCard](#-vCard)

It has not yet been tested. It may not work, as I experimentally tried to embed a placeholder for a base64 encoded image inside of it without using proper software.

#### [🪧️ Projects on other platforms](#-Projects-on-other-platforms)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I have been using GitHub for software development since May 25th 2020, but I have been programming since early 2016.

On December 21st 2020, I created accounts on SourceForge, GitLab, and BitBucket. I currently don't maintain any projects there at the moment, GitHub still is the powerhouse.

- [`SourceForge link`](https://sourceforge.net/u/seanpm2001/profile/)
- [`GitLab link`](https://gitlab.com/seanpm2001/)
- [`BitBucket link`](https://bitbucket.org/seanpm2001/)

When I joined GitHub, I also intended to use other platforms as well, as something could always go wrong with my account or GitHub itself, and it isn't smart to rely on a single source for everything.

Now, if GitHub is having problems or if you have problems with GitHub, my projects are viewable on 3 other platforms. Unfortunately, they are still only on GitHub, as I don't have enough developers to manage 4 platforms at once, I will eventually mirror my projects over.

### [📨️ Submissions](#-Submissions)

<details><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section]</b></p></summary>

I am open for accepting submissions for project artwork. I would like to receive skeumorphism and 3D designs for program graphics before I accept flat design and solid color works. I want to give people the option for both skeumorphism, 3D, 2D, Flat, solid color, or whatever the user prefers. I want to start with Skeumorphism, as it is the best (totally not an unbiased opinion)

My recommended formats are SVG (60% recommended) and PNG (40% recommended) for images. Non-graphical submissions can be in any format, as long as it is an open format and is not proprietary (for example: Jade programs are proprietary and currently can't be accepted)

| [:octocat: `Commit Count Milestones (CCM)`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Commit-Count-Milestones/) |

This repository records my commit count milestones: [:octocat: `seanpm2001/Commit-Count-Milestones`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Commit-Count-Milestones/)

Milestones are listed when a repository reaches:

- 10 commits

None of my repositories have yet reached 20000 commits (as of 2024, April 6th) and my account as a whole hasn't reached the 400000 commit count (as of 2024, April 6th)

From observing other accounts, I have noted that GitHub repositories get wonky after you reach 17.5 million (showing an ∞ (infinity) sign, instead of the actual number) and from user reports, [:octocat: `GitHub repositories get disabled at 22 million commits`](https://github.com/csm10495/commit-ment/)

New limits (proposed 2024.04.06, WIP)

- 1100000 commits

In 2020, I began to experiment with Artificial Intelligence, and by 2022, I had created the [:octocat: `AI2001 repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001/) due to the AI boom caused by ChatGPT. I felt that a more customized AI tool didn't exist, but more importantly, there were no ethical AI projects that I could find. Ethical AI has to be completely open source, and ChatGPT wasn't.

I have a project that documents my operating system data and usage (not individual files, but their structure, along with the operating system and its settings) data is kept in a unique way, with each operating system family gaining its own galaxy within a universe.

The project can be found [:octocat: `here`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansOSData/)

My dream project is a quantum computer operating system known as [:octocat: `Meadows`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/QMeadows/). I have a big vision for it (which I am having difficulty properly displaying) it is one of the projects I want to see functional before I die. A project goes alongside it, which is known as [:octocat: `Bliss Browser`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/bliss_browser/) these projects are part of my big computing dream that I hope to come true.

### [💷️ Thoughts on Blockchain and Web -3](#-Thoughts-on-Blockchain-and-Web-3)

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Web -3 began to gain popularity around the time I joined GitHub. I was a little gullible around this time, and tried creating related projects without knowing the full context. The more I researched it, the more I disliked it.

The thing I hate the most about it are NFTs, and the audacity for this movement to call itself the 3rd iteration of the web. I prefer calling it [:octocat: `Web negative three`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Web-negative-3/)

Blockchain and crypto mining is bad for the environment, and it is actively hurting the name of crypto (which stands for cryptography, **not** cryptocurrency)

Nonetheless, due to my follow for follow promise, I still follow a lot of NFT/cryptocurrency bots that follow me.

GitHub released achievements in 2020, with the arctic code vault achievement, and later the mars rover achievement. More mainstream achievements were added in 2022. I have earned some of them, but don't actively seek them. I have helped with documentation on other peoples repositories regarding achievements.

I refer to my headquarters as the core, and 2001 is its number. 2001 holds a lot of meaning to me. It is the year I was born, and a lot happened on that year. I embrace it as an identity, and have projects named after it (such as seanpm2001, AI2001, the 2001 archive. and more)

- **See also:** [:octocat: `Seanpm2001 Fork Style Guide`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001_Fork_Style-Guide/)

I actively fork repositories on GitHub to act as an archive of repositories I have come across, and less often, repositories that I actively use. There is a problem that started with GitHub around 2022 regarding forks that I don't like:

Previously, if the account of a fork got suspended/deleted, you could still see "forked from johndoe/myrepository" at the top of the screen. It would be a dead link, but it would at least attribute the user. Nowadays, when this happens, the forked repository is instead turned into a source repository, which makes the suggestion that I created this repository, and it really messes with my timeline.

### [🆓️ Software status](#-Software-status)

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

<img src="/DRM-free_label.en.svg" alt="DRM is anti-competitive and pure evil" title="DayAgainstDRM, DRM is very bad" width="100" height="100">

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
