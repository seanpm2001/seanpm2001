# Translation notes

I manually translate this document into over 100 languages with machine translation. Unfortunately, Machine Translation just isn't good enough. There are many errors, and they need to be fixed by people who speak the languages or see formatting problems. If you note a problem, [`please raise an issue`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/issues/) and provide a source (such as [`Wiktionary`](https://www.wiktionary.org/))

## Known problems

With V52 translations, Google Translate refused to let me translate the language table, and instead duplicated the previous translation. This can easily be fixed, but I don't have the time.

With V52 translations, not all languages were translated. The following translations were made:

English -> Arabic

English -> Chinese (Simplified)

English -> Chinese (Traditional)

English -> Esperanto

English -> French

English -> Georgian

English -> Japanese

English -> Korean (South)

English -> Korean (North) - Exact duplicate of Korean (South)

English -> Polish

English -> Portuguese

English -> Spanish

English -> Ukrainian

The rest of the translations were skipped due to time reasons, and since I should automate it instead.

Google Translate destroys the formatting of the translation, and introduces errors such as broken images, tables, headings, horizontal lines, and hyperlinks.

Most translations are not kept up to date, and all translations are missing many versions of the document. This should be fixed in the future with automation.

Google Translate isn't the best, but it is all that I have. I tried DeepL and Bing Translate, but they aren't as helpful.
