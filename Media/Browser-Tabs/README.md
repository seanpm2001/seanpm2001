In order to maintain these projects, I have a lot of tabs open, so that I can work with them when needed, have faster access, and have the ability to queue tasks. This video showcases my nightly process of recording tabs, at a record point in 2024, March (where I had 1,242 tabs open) since I am not using a Chromium-based browser, it is easier to have this many tabs open, especially light ones. It requires nearly 40 gigabytes of RAM to have 1242 tabs open at once.

The amount of tabs I have open as of April 1st is 1,144. I try to reduce them, but they build up rapidly.
