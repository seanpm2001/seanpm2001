# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 52, 2024, Sunday, May 12th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.12`

**Released on:** `2024, Sunday, May 12th at 09:56 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 52nd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fiftieth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I spent less time on the project today, but still made progress. I worked on structuring the last major section to be updated in this cycle: the `My current setup` section. Little work was done elsewhere.
