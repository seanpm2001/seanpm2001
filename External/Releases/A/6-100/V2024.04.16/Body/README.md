# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 26, 2024, Tuesday, April 16th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.16`

**Released on:** `2024, Tuesday, April 16th at 11:23 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 26th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twenty-fourth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This is the second update to officially come from 2024 April 16th. I missed yesterdays update, so I had to make 2 updates today. This update has more effort put into it, and also celebrates the main `README` file reaching version 100.
