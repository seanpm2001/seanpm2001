# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 14, 2024, Thursday, April 4th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.04`

**Released on:** `2024, Thursday, April 4th at 04:20 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 14th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the eleventh beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This is the first update in which the README file refuses to generate (I haven't even hit the 512 KiB limit yet, but I have surpassed 500 KB (488 KiB)) it glitches out the main repository a bit (sometimes the release section won't load, sometimes both the release section and languages section won't load, every time, the README won't load) I will have to temporarily remove some entries in tomorrows entry.
