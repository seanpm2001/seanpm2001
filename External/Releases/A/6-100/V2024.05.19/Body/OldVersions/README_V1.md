# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 59, 2024, Sunday, May 19th) (1 day late)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.19`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, May 20th at 02:39 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 59th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fifty-seventh beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created solely on 2024, Monday, May 20th. This update was delayed by 1 day, as I lost control of the project, and didn't have time to update it. Time is drawing close to the 2024, May 20th deadline, so I had to get caught back up today. This is purely a filler update. I hope to do something in the next update. On the day this update was supposed to be made, I had created new border/divider images, and I plan to utilize them in the next update.
