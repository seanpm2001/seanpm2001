# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 61, 2024, Tuesday, May 21st)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.21`

**Released on:** `2024, Tuesday, May 21st at 06:52 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 61st version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fifty-ninth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created solely on 2024, Tuesday, May 21st, and is one of the last 5 updates in the 4 Year Anniversary Update. Maintenance was done today, there are still 3 more days for me to finish the final goal, and I plan to go slowly, as it isn't a hard goal to implement. I didn't realize until publishing that the README overflowed earlier than expected (it appears the README size limit is 500 KiB, not 512 KiB) This will be fixed in tomorrows update.
