**Tag:** `V2024.04.22`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, April 22nd at 10:00 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 32nd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirtieth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Small changes were made again today. More segmentation work was found and completed, a couple new sections were added, and some sections were improved.
