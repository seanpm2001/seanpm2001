# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 15, 2024, Friday, April 5th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.05`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, April 5th at 12:12 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 15th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twelfth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I fixed the README rendering issue in this update, but some problems with dropdowns were introduced, that I will try to fix in the next update. A lot of sections got moved out to try and bring the file down to a size that it could render. This didn't work, and I instead found the actual problem and fixed it. Nonetheless, the file is much cleaner now.
