# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 18, 2024, Monday, April 8th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.08`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, April 8th at 02:34 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 18th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the sixteenth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I am putting so much work into each update that it becomes very tempting to release prematurely. I am limiting myself to one release per day.
