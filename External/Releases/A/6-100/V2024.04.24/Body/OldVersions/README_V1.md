# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 34, 2024, Wednesday, April 24th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.24`

**Released on:** `2024, Wednesday, April 24th at 9:00 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 34th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-second beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Small changes were made today, as I had less time. Today, I focused on creating 3 new sections, and completing 3 small goals outlined in my todo list. Last night, I uploaded hundreds of files for use in a later project (although not every image is going to be used, it was just easier to upload them all at once, instead of searching through hundreds of items and finding the ones I need) 

I am also in the planning phase of a major update (involving my system setup) and I was considering creating the certificates section today, but I was getting too much glare on my camera. I don't have the time to take them down and take pictures, so it will have to wait.
