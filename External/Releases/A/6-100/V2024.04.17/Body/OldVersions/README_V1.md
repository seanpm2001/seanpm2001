# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 27, 2024, Wednesday, April 17th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.17`

**Released on:** `2024, Wednesday, April 17th at 11:32 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 27th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twenty-fifth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update came very close to midnight, updates have been getting later and later lately. My schedule is a very difficult beast to control. It is taking me months to regain control, and I say it a lot, but I am again making progress on getting caught back up, and I feel that I can get caught up by 2024, June 14th, as long as I don't get thrown too hard too many times again.
