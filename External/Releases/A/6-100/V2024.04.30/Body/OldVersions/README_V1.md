# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 40, 2024, Tuesday, April 30th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.30`

**Released on:** `2024, Tuesday, April 30th at 11:16 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 40th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-eighth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published slightly earlier in the day, and still way too close to midnight. I have been setbacks today, dealing with a lot of procrastination issues in the evening, where I set the time to work on this project. Today, the final update for 2024 April was created. There are only 25 more days left to work on this update. I made some progress today, but not on most of the remaining goals. 3 segments were updated, and 1 new segment was added. I only had a little under 1 hour to work on todays update.
