# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 33, 2024, Tuesday, April 23rd)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.23`

**Released on:** `2024, Tuesday, April 23rd at 06:10 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 33rd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-first beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Major changes were made today in one area. I spent several hours going through the entire README and collecting heading titles, adding comments, and segmenting the last entries I could find. I used this heading data to make an extensive update to the table of contents, where the table of contents was restored in list format, and also table format. I am low on things to do in my todo list, although the tasks left are very advanced, and take a lot of time.

My next major plan is to revamp my system setup section, but some other tasks may come first.
