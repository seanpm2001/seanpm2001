# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 37, 2024, Saturday, April 27th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.27`

**Released on:** `2024, Saturday, April 76th at 10:51 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 37th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-fifth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published much later in the day. I have been really distracted this evening, as I prepare to get caught up on a project that is behind all the way down to 2024, February 12th (graphic design work) small updates were made here today, with 2 very small goals achieved (using a banner image and adding a humor section to the README)

I am still also in the planning phase of a major update (involving my system setup)
