# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 45, 2024, Sunday, May 5th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.05`

**Released on:** `2024, Sunday, May 5th at 07:30 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 45th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the forty-third beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published later in the day, written and published in the mid evening. This was a very small maintenance update, where no new goals were worked on. A small but notable set of improvments were made, where I started something important that I had started to develop last night: a system of definitive commented headings for certain key sections of a README file (translation, index, file info, file history, and footer) which is planned to better automate the process of modifying, organizing, and displaying README files. This is now the first project to use this new system.
