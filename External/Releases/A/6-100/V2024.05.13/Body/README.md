# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 53, 2024, Monday, May 13th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.13`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, May 13th at 11:12 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 53rd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fifty-first beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I spent less time on the project today, but still made some progress. I worked on structuring the last major section to be updated in this cycle: the `My current setup` section. Little work was done here or elsewhere.
