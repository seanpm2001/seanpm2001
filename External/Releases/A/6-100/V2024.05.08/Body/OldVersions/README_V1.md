# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 48, 2024, Thursday, May 9th, 1 day late)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.08`

**Released on:** `2024, Thursday, May 9th at 10:49 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 48th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the forty-sixth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

I completely skipped work on this project yesterday, so I had to produce 2 updates today. This first update was a smaller one, but it accomplished one of the 9 remaining goals. I have until 11:45 pm to get the next update ready.
