# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 36, 2024, Friday, April 26th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.26`

**Released on:** `2024, Friday, April 26th at 02:26 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 356h version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the thirty-fourth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update was published very early in the day. Small changes were made again today, as I didn't feel like spending much time here today. Not much is required for some updates, it is a profile, after all. Today, the index was updated, and a section about certifications was added, as I finally got the pictures I needed.

I am still also in the planning phase of a major update (involving my system setup)
