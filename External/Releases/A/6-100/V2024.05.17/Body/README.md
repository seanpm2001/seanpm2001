# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 57, 2024, Friday, May 17th) (3 days late)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.17`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, May 20th at 02:11 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 57th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fifty-fifthfourth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created solely on 2024, Monday, May 20th. This update was delayed by 2 days, as I lost control of the project, and didn't have time to update it. Time is drawing close to the 2024, May 20th deadline, so I had to get caught back up today. This is purely a filler update.
