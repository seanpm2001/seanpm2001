# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 60, 2024, Monday, May 20th)

**Tag:** `V2024.05.20`

**Released on:** `2024, Monday, May 20th at 04:46 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 60th version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the fifty-eighth beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

This update was created solely on 2024, Monday, May 20th. I managed to get caught back up on this project again today, and only have to keep up to date for 5 more days, before the 4 year anniversary update culminates. This update focuses heavily on usage of dividers.
