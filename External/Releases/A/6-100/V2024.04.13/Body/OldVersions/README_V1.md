# 4 year anniversary update (Beta 23, 2024, Saturday, April 13th)

**Tag:** `V2024.04.13`

**Released on:** `2024, Saturday, April 13th at 10:37 pm PST`

***Pre-release***

This is the 23rd version of the 4 year anniversary update beta. The full release will be created on 2024, Saturday, May 25th. This is the twenty-first beta release to be tagged. In the future, I plan to tag the first 3 betas, I just don't know how to right now. These updates should continue daily for a while.

Todays update came several hours late. I worked on getting caught up on other projects, and also had to travel out of town today, so despite waking up really early, I still didn't have much time for this project. Nevertheless, at least 1 goal was accomplished, and a consecutive update was made. I hope to do more tomorrow.
