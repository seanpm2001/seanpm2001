<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

I had a very good with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

I fell behind on Git-image work (part B) <!-- I also did further work on the SNU Blockchain ad system (which again, has been abandoned, as of writing this, due to ethical issues) !--> I did delete `IGNORE.md` files en masse in my main GitHub images repository. I also resumed work on the Talla Browser project, and the Slick License Manager project, each project getting a lot of documentation work done to them.

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

Additionally today, I updated my Scratch image repository. The Internet went out today from 7:02 PST pm to 7:41 pm PST (39 minutes)

<!--

I did update some of the repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following programming languages:

- [x] Prolog

!-->

I am still far behind on my status posts.

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !--> I didn't do anything else today.

<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I have stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, as of 2022, April 26th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet.

2022, ThursdaY, April 26th status notes

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
