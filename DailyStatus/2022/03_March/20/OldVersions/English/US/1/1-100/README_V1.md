<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

<!-- Notes 2022.03.19
2022 Saturday March 19th status notes

Mass work today, raising the bar a bit
UCALC worked on
AUTHORS.md, CREDITS.wiki, INSTALL.rst trifecta across several projects
Getting caught up on every daily project except for the last 2
Going to bed slightly early
Profile view counter broken yesterday, GitHub was at fault, the issue was fixed
Gaming sessions long
Daily Git-image work part A skipped
Meadows Begin updated, CFG file, 36 operating systems planned to be supported
-->

I had an extremely good day with development again today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Yesterdays entry stated that "this was the day of the week where I did GitHub organization work" this was an error, I forgot to remove it from the Saturday entry before posting.

I did mass work today on 20 different projects again. I stayed caught up on all the Git-image tasks, and most of the documentation tasks. I also began preparing a volume 4 repository of Tree World images.

I did some work on the DroppedText Corpus project today, it has improved documentation, and now utilizes 2 out of 10 of the file extensions used by the language. I got my Khan Academy data repository further up to date today as well. I also did the usual once-every-2-days image work.

I hope to get caught up on the other 2 projects today. I have lowered the status of Git-template uploads, as the task is now considered too easy to list as a major entry, and I want to increase my morale on getting caught up.

Here are the last 2 projects I have left:

```text
The last 2

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2. GitHub Activity files
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
