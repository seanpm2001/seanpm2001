2022 May 25th GitHub status notes

2 Year GitHub anniversary
ProtonDrive near complete failure, proton.me pCloud as alternative for the day
Wac OS X 10.0 work started
A day to catch up on Git-image failed, as I procrastinated with other projects
Food index update
WacOS work
Brainfuck IDE, source code from a recent guest provided with permission (they told me I didn't need to credit them, but I did anyways, 5.2 kilobytes of functional brainfuck source code is a lot of work, especially when I can't even write a hello world program in the language yet. Plus, I give credit by default, no matter how much or how little effort wad given)
Staying somewhat caught up
Still falling behind on GitHub Git-image, and GitHub status posts
VLCSV logo update
!-->

I had a good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today was my 2 year GitHub anniversary. Unfortunately, I did not really celebrate it today, it was just a normal day.

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

I fell behind on Git-image part B work (and stayed caught up on Git-image part A work) I worked on several repositories, unique updates today went towards the VLCSV software library repository, mainly receiving a new, improved version of the VLCSV box logo. Other repositories changed today include the new WacOS X 10.0 subsystem repository, and the WacOS core repository. The SNU brainfuck IDE received an update, but it was too difficult to write in the language, so it wasn't done in full. I did modernize the project partially. I also included source code from a recent guest provided with permission (they told me I didn't need to credit them, but I did anyways, 5.2 kilobytes of functional brainfuck source code is a lot of work, especially when I can't even write a hello world program in the language yet. Plus, I give credit by default, no matter how much or how little effort wad given)

I had today to catch up on Git-image work, but I failed, as I procrastinated with other projects. ProtonDrive also had a near complete failure today, I wasn't told that the switch to proton.me was mandatory, so I used pCloud today, and stopped using ProtonDrive. I later got ProtonDrive to work, the Proton company cut off functionality to ProtonDrive outside of the proton.me address without explanation, and it made me think the service finally failed. I consider this a failure as well.

I created 6 repositories today, 5 of them were forks, the other one was the new Wac OS X 10.0 subsystem source repository. I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I am still far behind on my status posts. I have also stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over a month later, as of 2022, May 25th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
