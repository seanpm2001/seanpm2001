<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

I had an good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

My notes were mislabeled, I forgot to write yesterdays notes due to this. Here they are:

I made several innovations to the GOI projects documentation and structure. The statistics processs ran for 1 hour and 52 minutes, and I got little work done today. The process was also very distracting. I did brief Git-image work today.

Now for today:

I worked on the WacOS project again today, working on the following new repositories:

- WacOS WacTVOS Software Calculator
- WacOS WacTVOS Software
- WacOS WhyWatchOS Software Calculator
- WacOS WhyWatchOS Software
- WacOS WhyPadOS Software Calculator
- WacOS WhyPadOS Software

I have been putting tons of work into WacOS lately. I also made updates to the core WacOS source repository. I went and created 6 repositories today, of which 6 of them are new WacOS projects.

I did mass work to the GOI repository today, and also worked on the V8 Git repository template today, creating a WacOS branch. I am still falling really far behind on GitHub status posts.

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

I worked heavily on the GOI repository today, and stayed caught up with Git-image part A work (but not part B work)

The new stats repository takes over an hour to process the results. I thought the day 1 results were good, I would later find that they can get much better.

<!-- I recently ordered another new laptop, we got refunded for Dell's failure, and I went with System76. It was a mistake to NOT go with them for all these years. They outperformed Dell on day 1 (price) and then in less than 24 hours, the laptop was already built, and was on its way. What Dell couldn't do in 90+ days, System76 did in less than 24 hours. !-->

I fell further behind on Git-image part B work again today. <!-- I created 9 repositories today, 3 of them are forks, the other 6 were WacOS subsystem home repositories. !--> I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I am still far behind on my status posts. I have also stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over 2 months later, as of 2022, June 13th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
