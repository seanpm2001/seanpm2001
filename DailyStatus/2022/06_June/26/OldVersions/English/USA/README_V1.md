I had a good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

<!--
I worked on the WacOS project briefly yet again today, working on the following new repositories:

- WhyPadOS
- WhyPadOS 13
- WhyPadOS 14
- WhyPadOS 15
- WhyPadOS 16

I have been putting tons of work into WacOS lately. I made some small updates to the core WacOS source repository today. I created 8 new projects today, of which 6 were forks, and 2 were sources. !-->

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

Today, I worked mostly on the GNOME System Monitor image repository project heavily, and also updated my battery documentation, adding support for Ubuntu 22.04, and System76 Pangolin hardware. I got caught back up on Git-image part B work, finalizing it today. I additionally stayed caught up with Git-image part A work. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog up to date, along with the audio database. I also added Dylan and Lingo support to WacOS.

The new stats repository takes over an hour to process the results. I thought the day 1 results were good, I would later find that they can get much better. I didn't update the repository today, but I let it run, which it did unsuccessfully today.

GitHub was inconsistent with commits in the late evening/nighttime, and it dropped 9 to ~90 commits on my profile. It later dropped again from 38706 to 38705, then dropped below 38700, and I could not regain it tonight. I really hope it is a miscalculation/correction of a miscalculation. There was also a minor bug with my laptop today, where I unplugged it within 30 seconds of it reaching 100% battery, and something went wrong, as it took 2 minutes to detect that I had unplugged it.

<!-- I recently ordered another new laptop, we got refunded for Dell's failure, and I went with System76. It was a mistake to NOT go with them for all these years. They outperformed Dell on day 1 (price) and then in less than 24 hours, the laptop was already built, and was on its way. What Dell couldn't do in 90+ days, System76 did in less than 24 hours. !--> <!-- I created 9 repositories today, 3 of them are forks, the other 6 were WacOS subsystem home repositories. !--> I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I am still far behind on my status posts. I have plans to start getting caught back up tomorrow. I have also stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over 2 months later, as of 2022, June 26th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
