I had a decent day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th. I made significant progress on getting caught up, but there are still some projects left.

<!--
I worked on the WacOS project briefly yet again today, working on the following new repositories:

- WhyPadOS
- WhyPadOS 13
- WhyPadOS 14
- WhyPadOS 15
- WhyPadOS 16

I have been putting tons of work into WacOS lately. I made some small updates to the core WacOS source repository today. I created 8 new projects today, of which 6 were forks, and 2 were sources. !-->

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

Today, I resumed getting caught back up on status post work. I decided to do 1 month per day. I finished entries for 2022, June 1st to 2022 June 28th. I am now all caught up on this project, I just have to keep it consistently up to date now.

While I was catching up, I made several errors, due to a confusion with GitHub using PDT (Pacific Daylight Time) in some areas, and PST (Pacific Standard Time) in others. I also had issues with notes, but these errors can be corrected.

Today, I additionally got caught up on Git-image part A & B work, and did no WacOS work, with plans to resume still on hold. I worked on the very verbose UHS (Ukraine History Simulator) project, I am making very slow progress on this project, as there is a ton to it. Hopefully, when the project goes public, I will get people who want to help with it. I am still in the planning phase of it. I did create a developer `parliament` for the project, where decisions can be voted on. Currently, it is internal between me and 2 other family members, but it will be expanded.

I also did a small update to my video directory repository today, adding recent download notes. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog up to date, along with the audio database.

The new stats repository takes over an hour to process the results. The results have been really good for the past 2 days (2022, June 28th to 2022 June 29th) the best they have ever been. I hope it can remain stable like this for a while.

<!-- I recently ordered another new laptop, we got refunded for Dell's failure, and I went with System76. It was a mistake to NOT go with them for all these years. They outperformed Dell on day 1 (price) and then in less than 24 hours, the laptop was already built, and was on its way. What Dell couldn't do in 90+ days, System76 did in less than 24 hours. !--> <!-- I created 9 repositories today, 3 of them are forks, the other 6 were WacOS subsystem home repositories. !--> I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I am still far behind on my status posts. I have plans to start getting caught back up tomorrow. I have also stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over 2 months later, as of 2022, June 29th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
