<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

I had an OK day with development again today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

<!--
I worked on the WacOS project briefly yet again today, working on the following new repositories:

- WhyPadOS
- WhyPadOS 13
- WhyPadOS 14
- WhyPadOS 15
- WhyPadOS 16

I have been putting tons of work into WacOS lately. I made some small updates to the core WacOS source repository today. I created 8 new projects today, of which 6 were forks, and 2 were sources. !-->

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

Today, I resumed getting caught back up on status post work. I decided to do 1 month per day. It took much longer than expected. I finished entries for 2022, May 1st to 2022 May 31st, but it took so much time, I had to fall behind on Git-image part B work. Tomorrow, I plan to catch up on 2022, June 1st to 2022, June 29th, then I will be all caught up on the project.

The project took much longer than expected, and was a bit repetitive. I also noticed a new GitHub bug, where I cannot view contributions while hovering after you click a link on the userpage, and go back, you have to refresh first. GitHub's daily blog isn't logging everything as well, it is missing a lot

Looking back, I fell behind on Git-image work alot in the past 3 months. It looks meek in comparison to the status post work. I hope the posts will improve once I am caught up again, and only have to make 1 post per day, instead of over a dozen.

Before I started to resume getting caught up on status posts today, I started some new projects. I updated the V8 Git repository template, so that the `Template-Other` branch would be on par with the `WacOS-other` branch, so that I could use it with new projects. I then started 4 new projects:

- Kotlint

> I created an organization for this project weeks ago ([`@Kotlint-dev`](https://github.com/Kotlint-dev/)) but I didn't make its homepage until today. Right now, it is highly incomplete.

- Learn Gherkin

> I intend to get back to work on my `learn` repositories again, and Gherkin was a must, as I have been learning this language recently. Currently, this project is incomplete, except for the structure.

- Notchware

> This is the general definition and documentation project for the term `Notchware`

- Ukraine History Simulator

> This project was a lot more verbose than I expected. It is a simulator where one can control Ukraine at any point in its 47000+ year history. There are already enough WW2 simulator games, and hardly any on Ukraine, and I decided to choose it for my first history simulator game. It is still in the planning phase, and will take a while until it is ready.

Notchware and Ukraine History Simulator are going to remain private until 2022, July 1st, when they will be made public. The other 2 were released publicly on day 1.

I also did 1 update to my graphic design repository today.

I fell behind on Git-image part B work. I additionally stayed caught up with Git-image part A work. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog up to date, along with the audio database.

The new stats repository takes over an hour to process the results. I thought the day 1 results were good, I would later find that they can get much better. I didn't update the repository today, but I let it run, which it did successfully today.

<!-- I recently ordered another new laptop, we got refunded for Dell's failure, and I went with System76. It was a mistake to NOT go with them for all these years. They outperformed Dell on day 1 (price) and then in less than 24 hours, the laptop was already built, and was on its way. What Dell couldn't do in 90+ days, System76 did in less than 24 hours. !--> <!-- I created 9 repositories today, 3 of them are forks, the other 6 were WacOS subsystem home repositories. !--> I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I am still far behind on my status posts. I have plans to start getting caught back up tomorrow. I have also stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over 2 months later, as of 2022, June 28th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
