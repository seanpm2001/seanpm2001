<!-- Todays notes
Misc: why I like SuperTuxCart
!-->

I had a decent day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

I worked on the WacOS project again today, working on the following new repositories:

- WacOS BaSYS Software
- WacOS BaSYS Software Calculator
- WOAHS-X Software 
- WOAHS-X Software Calculator 

Along with some new, but older repositories:

- WacOS 10.12
- WacOS 10.13
- WacOS 10.14
- WacOS 10.15
- WacOS 11
- WacOS 12
- WacOS X

I have been putting tons of work into WacOS lately. I also made updates to the core WacOS source repository. I went and created 4 repositories today, of which 4 of them are the new WacOS subprojects for today. I am still falling really far behind on GitHub status posts.

My new System76 Pangolin laptop arrived today, and I began setting it up at 5:00 pm. The operating system was already installed, it just required setting the time zone, network info, and some other basic information, then it worked immediately. So far, it is working really well. I got some software installed on it. I decided not to purge the snap store this time. I later moved some files onto it, and transitioned to it later in the night. I thought Ubuntu 22.04 was going to be a giant problem, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

My new laptop has 32 gigabytes of RAM, so RAM will no longer be a problem. I was also surprised to find 16 CPU cores on it (even though the laptop said 4) I am starting to understand what a CPU thread is due to this.

I wanted to play SuperTuxKart, as it was a game I have been considering demo-ing on this laptop for a week now. I have come to love the game, even though I never played it. It is essentially the Mario Kart of Linux, and instead of the Nintendo roster, you get the open source roster. Unfortunately, SuperTuxKart refuses to run on Ubuntu 22.04, and just crashes. I tried both through the GUI, and through the terminal, the game is unbootable.

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

<!-- I recently ordered another new laptop, we got refunded for Dell's failure, and I went with System76. It was a mistake to NOT go with them for all these years. They outperformed Dell on day 1 (price) and then in less than 24 hours, the laptop was already built, and was on its way. What Dell couldn't do in 90+ days, System76 did in less than 24 hours. !-->

I worked heavily on the WacOS project, and I fell behind on Git-image part A & B work today. <!-- I created 9 repositories today, 3 of them are forks, the other 6 were WacOS subsystem home repositories. !--> I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I am still far behind on my status posts. I have also stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over 2 months later, as of 2022, June 8th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
