I had a very good day with development today. <!-- I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th. I made progress on getting caught up, but there are still some projects left. !-->

<!--
I worked on the WacOS project briefly yet again today, working on the following new repositories:

- WhyPadOS
- WhyPadOS 13
- WhyPadOS 14
- WhyPadOS 15
- WhyPadOS 16

I have been putting tons of work into WacOS lately. I made some small updates to the core WacOS source repository today. I created 8 new projects today, of which 6 were forks, and 2 were sources. !-->

<!-- Today was the day of the week where I create organizations. The majority of my time on GitHub went towards creating and documenting organizations. As usual, data for this can be found [here (`GitHub_Organization_Info`)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) !-->

HerdSpeak project

Today, I stayed caught up on status post work, along with Git-image part B work, and I stayed caught up with Git-image part A work. I have recently updated my API guidelines, and I have been actively going through projects, including old ones, to apply the new changes.

With `Learn` repositories today, I updated the core [`Learn repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) along with the [`Learn-Ada`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Ada/) and [`Learn-Solidity`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Solidity/) projects. I finalized the Solidity repository, as I wanted to get it over with, the Ada repository still needs work. I am getting back into this project.

I did mass work, and also updated the Ukraine History Simulator, and added 1 new graphic design asset to my graphic design repository.

I started a new project today known as [`HerdSpeak`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/HerdSpeak/) which is a fork of Cowsay. I intend to extend the project, and keep development going. Notable new features include:

- [ ] A simple Cowfile creator (both CLI (terminal) and GUI)
- [ ] Plans to port to BSD, MacOS, Windows, and other operating systems
- [ ] Standardization of the Cow file format
- [ ] And more!

These projects were modified today. I also made 4 forks today, of some cowsay projects.

I didn't do any WacOS work, with plans to resume still on hold. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog up to date, along with the audio database.

The new stats repository takes over an hour to process the results. The results have been poor for the past 3 days.

<!-- I recently ordered another new laptop, we got refunded for Dell's failure, and I went with System76. It was a mistake to NOT go with them for all these years. They outperformed Dell on day 1 (price) and then in less than 24 hours, the laptop was already built, and was on its way. What Dell couldn't do in 90+ days, System76 did in less than 24 hours. !--> <!-- I created 9 repositories today, 3 of them are forks, the other 6 were WacOS subsystem home repositories. !--> I didn't do anything else today on GitHub.

<!-- I fell behind on Git-image work (part A & B) !-->

<!--
Today was day 15 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I only updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/), I did not update any of the projects other repositories today.
!-->

<!-- Today was day 12 of getting back into the project of archiving my programming language knowledge. I updated the main [Learn](https://github.com/seanpm200/Learn/) project, although I didn't create any new repositories in this category today.!--> <!-- and created repositories for showcasing my knowledge of the following 8 programming langages:

- [x] Isabelle
- [x] Io
- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Inno Setup
- [x] INI
- [x] Inform
- [x] Idris
- [x] IDL
!-->

<!--
I updated the following `learn` language repositories today:

- [x] ImageJ
- [x] Io
- [x] Isabelle
!-->

<!-- I didn't update any other `learn` repositories today. !-->
<!-- I also did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in my GitHub image repository again today. !-->

I have stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has made it to 15th birthday, and is still going strong, over 3 months later, as of 2022, July 4th. She is having off days from time to time, but nothing too serious yet. She has greatly exceeded our expectation on life expectancy, and is still going.

## 2022 July 4th protest

I am going to get a bit political here: this year, I didn't celebrate the 4th of July this year, due to ongoing and increasing issues with police brutality (notably the 8 police officers who shot an unarmed black man over 70 times, which is basically death by firing squad) reduction of human rights, monopolies getting bigger, constant mass shootings, rising Fascism and Authoritarianism, and many other reasons. I still respect this country somewhat, but there isn't much worth celebrating at the moment.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
