I signed up for the GitHub sponsors program on 2025, Saturday, August 9th. I was approved on 2025, Tuesday, August 12th at 04:20 pm PST.

I have lacked a proper method of receiving donations for years now, and now I finally have one established.

The setup process faced some challenges, such as not being able to choose certain repositories to pin (they apparently need 5 or more stars to be capable of being pinned, due to how many repositories I have that have 5 stars or more) furthermore, I tried to add some new repositories to the pins of my regular profile, but couldn't do so through search, or the pin button itself. I could not pin the following repositories on either the sponsors profile, or my main GitHub profile:

- [:octocat: `seanpm2001/EMAIL_2.0`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/EMAIL_2.0/)
- [:octocat: `seanpm2001/BerryBoot`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BerryBoot/)
- [:octocat: `seanpm2001/LennyOS`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/LennyOS/)

## Notes

- Each tier has a 750 character limit
- For my profile repository, I am trying to keep the file structure for my sponsors section as close as possible to the URL scheme for the sponsors page, to add cross compatibility
- My sponsor page is like a wiki, and can be edited by others through a pull request. Some of the descriptions are really lacking right now, and I plan to improve as I go.

## Tests

- **2025, August 10th:** _Unfortunately, images cannot be added to the description of sponsor tiers. They just show up as a link, and don't embed an image into the targetted area._
