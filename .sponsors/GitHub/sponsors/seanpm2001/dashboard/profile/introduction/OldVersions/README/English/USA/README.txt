# Introduction

I use open source as a way to express my ideas, and to create art. I have many ideas that I hope to develop, but I need volunteers and funding to achieve this.

I am currently raising funds to start an organization, buy storage, and buy server hardware. A short term goal is to have my own server, and at least 5 active volunteers on my projects.

Description is a work in progress.
