# SpecialPage:5 Year anniversary of Seanpm2001

**2025, Sunday, May 25th**

Today marks 5 years since the transition from @seanwallawalla to @seanpm2001 began. The Seanpm2001 era is coming up on being nearly double the age of the SeanWallaWalla era, which went nonstop between 2015 and 2018 (3 years) I can't believe it has already been 5 years
