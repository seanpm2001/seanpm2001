## Stock photography

I take screenshots constantly while playing most games. I have repurposed this from only being progress tracking to stock photography.

The stock images I produce contain no watermarks, I won't even require credit to be given on their usage. Note that plagiarism is still not allowed, you don't have to credit me, but you can't claim the images as your own.

I have hundeds of thousands of stock photos at the moment, totaling well over 50 gigabytes. I have stock photos for:
