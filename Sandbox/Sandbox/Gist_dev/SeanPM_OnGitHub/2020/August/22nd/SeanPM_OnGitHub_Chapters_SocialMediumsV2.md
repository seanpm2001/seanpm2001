[Click here to see my original Scratch account](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) - It is a bit cringy, as it is from past me. Most of what I wrote back then no longer reflects who I am. I have changed an incredible amount since then, as I can change to seem like a completely different person by the month

**Original main account (it was going to be my main account, but I decided to stick with the latter)**

Username: @seanwallawalla

Years active: 2015-2016

I have a few other Scratch accounts, but I currently don't have enough time to add them to this list, and I will need to use a little bit of processing power to find them.

If you want to see the other accounts, just ask me (but not on July 26th 2020)

### Old Patreon

I created a Patreon account in July of 2020, solely to be able to have a sponsor button on my projects, and to receive donation revenue, as that is one of the only ways of making money in the OSS Business. You can view it [here](https://www.patreon.com/seanpm2001).

I have no way of earning money here yet, as no bank account has been connected.
