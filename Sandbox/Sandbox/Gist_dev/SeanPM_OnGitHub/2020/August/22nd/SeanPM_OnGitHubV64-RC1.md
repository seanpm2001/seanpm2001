# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. /

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part.

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. File name truncation at 255 chars

> 6. No others at the moment

# Commit counts on GitHub

This is a list of my daily commit counts on GitHub since my registration on May 25th 2020, along with blank entries from the creation of GitHub to the time I joined.

On July 31st 2020, I split this section off into its own article to save space here, so that I don't reach the GistHub limit.

# August 2020 DS

This section contains 31 subsections for daily August 2020 entries.

***This section was last updated on August 1st 2020 (08.01.2020)***

## August 1st 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I woke up really late today, at 11:50 am. I didn't start working until nearly an hour later. I had to do some chores today, but I also had some noise issues while working, as I am sensitive to noise. Some good noise related news is that I found a really good song I overlooked today.

Today on GitHub, I again focused on separating my main Gist (SeanPM_OnGitHub) into separate chapters to reduce the size, and make it more readable. My current goal is to get it under 5000 lines, something I unfortunately didn't have enough time to achieve today.

I also focused on work for other projects as well, such as several updates to the SNU 2D Programming tools repository, and also adding a Wiki to the UShortcut pro repository.

I got most of the sections with subsections taken out, with only a few left. I could easily reach my goal by moving the daily status or version history sections out, but I am currently deciding if I should. The version history section will stay, as it is essential, but I am deciding if the daily status section is essential.

I have significantly reduced the size of this Gist in the past 46 hours, reducing it by over 380,000 kilobytes, and by over 10000 lines. I plan on making the majority of this Gist link off to a separate Gist. This process takes time, and I am still working on it.

I also began to learn the Boo and Vala programming languages today, as a part time project, and I changed my interface for Linux again significantly. I also finished a major update on the Khan Academy archive, and released the first version of the UShortcut_Pro shortcut tool. Today was a really good day for development.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * How to customize the dock

> * No other Linux discoveries from August 1st 2020

## August 2nd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a decent day for develpment. I worked on a few different projects, including some Gidt work, but I didn't produce an update to my main Gist. I did 5 chapter Gist updated though.

Today was difficult personally, there was a lot of noise, and distractions. I still got a decent amount done. Today I worked on finalizing an update to the SNU Programming tools module, providing Gist repository updates, and updating the SNU Font LIBraru module with some new data I found, along with some ideas for tomorrow. This repository hasn't been updated in over a month. I work on things in cycles, where I work heavily on one thing, then move on to the next thing, then come back.

I learned that version 5.8 of the Linux kernel was released today. As a Linux user, I now plan to check for updates more often, and review things that might make their way into the next major update to Ubuntu, Fedora, or whatever I will be using.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Posting an issue counts as a commit

> * The GitHub marketplace is where I can get bots for my projects.

> * No other GitHub discoveries on August 2nd 2020

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Linux 5.8 was released today

> * No other Linux discovieres on August 2nd 2020

## August 3rd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a good day for development. Althought I didn't make very many commits, I completed every goal I set for myself today successfully and smoothly, along with some additional projects. I finally got the Gist below 5000 lines by separating 9 more chapters, however I am going to need to trim it more, as I came really close to 5000. I feel like I am going to have to raise the goalm as trimming it won't work for much longer.

I have exported a total of 30 chapters. I have also decided that the daily status section will stay, but older logs might be archived. Today, I worked on the SNU Font LIBrary module, my Khan Academy archive, the SNU Programming Tools module, adding support for 5 BASIC dialects, and also work on the Gist archive repository. I published this Gist early, so I can prepare an update for tomorrow and also try to go to bed earlier, so there might be new content on this entry tomorrow.

## August 4th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value.

I had a stressful day today. I didn't get too much done because of this. I plan on going to bed even earlier tonight as well. The Gist chapter process has been finished, except for 3 last chapters I will export tomorrow. It won't be as stressful and time consuming as today though. Today I got stressed out originally, as I thought there were 30 chapters, not 20. I eventually got it done, but I had severe tension and stress, along with heavy distractions in the first 3 hours of attempts.

Today, I also started work on a new project I thought of yesterday and heavily debated with myself if I should go through with it, which I decided I would. The idea is to create the worlds first free and open source microwave operating system. It is specifically going to be a smart Microwave that doesn't rely on the Internet, but can still access it. I am still thinking on if having a full-fledged web browser is necessary for it, I think it might be a little overkill, but it could be necessary at times. It is also my first project to have a non-Latin letter in its name, this specific project uses the greek letter mu (μ) or micro, as then it can be for minicomputer microwaves and microcomputer microwaves. 

I exported the rest of the sections of this Gist into separate chapter Gists today, except for 3 new sections I created, which I will try to export tomorrow. I also moved the June and July 2020 entries into their own Gist, which also significantly saved space. Today, I created 20 new chapter Gists. It took me nearly 2 hours to prepare for this last night.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * The 404 page is actually a set of images

> * Private repositories are not visible to public, for some weird reason, I thought they would be

> * You can change the status of a private repository, it isn't stuck private

> * No other GitHub discoveries on August 4th 2020

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Nothing :(

## August 5th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a difficult day for me. I didn't get too much done, and I was constantly distracted. I also got a little bit over 6 hours of sleep last night. I did learn a few things today, and I got some day. Less commits has become a new normal, I need to work on this. I had a day filled with unnecessary tension and stress.

I got a little bit done today, such as some important updates to the Programming Tools part of my site, which include increased support for more languages, a new GitHub and GistHub (gist.github.com) mode, where I came pretty close (for less than 35 minutes of time) of recreating the new Gist page.

Some goals I set that I couldn't accomplish today include updates to the μMicrowave project, I was going to lay more of the foundation today. A miscellaneous secondary goal I missed was adding in Khan Academy content for November 2018. I got all my other tasks accomplished.

I also started work on a new repository today, which is a weather part of the site. I heard more completely reasonable complaints from my parents about finding a good weather app. My grandpa noted that AccuWeather updated and he lost functionality. I have noticed this for many other Weather Apps in the current year, and I have seen reviews of the top 30 weather apps, they aren't as good as they should be.

I don't check the weather too often, but I think it might be important to me as well if I had an app for it, as I can't find a good one. The problem is that there aren't very many reliable weather apps anymore. So I started my own today, SNU WeatherVane. I will try to begin development on it tomorrow if I am feeling better. I also had to skip my journaling today and only do notes, which is a last resort. I really just wasn't feeling well today. I was fine all day up until the evening (5:00 pm)

I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day, today wasn't a complete failure, I had a good mood for the first half of it, and a few hours after that. 

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing :(

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * You can rename multiple files at once (another thing you can't do on Windows or Windows 10)

> * VLC almost crashed twice, and the whole system became unresponsive when SWAP/Virtual memory filled, and the RAM usage reached 99.9% this isn't a Windows only issue. Another reason of proof of why the "unused RAM is wasted RAM" argument is utter bull%#$@ I have known for years that this argument is garbage, even years before I got into Scratch in 2015. I always knew that using up too much memory would cause a system crash. So theres that too.

> * My first Linux crash was not a system issue, it was a user issue. I can now say I have had 0 

> * GNOME detects .vb files as VirtualBoy ROM image files, not VB.NET script files, which is a good thing to me

> * Starting to learn how to use GNOME Transmission (the Torrent client that came with my system)

> * No other Linux discoveries on August 5th 2020

Other:

> * I learned that Favicons don't have to use an ICO file at all

> * I relearned how to use the HTML5 `<select>` tag

> * That there is a difference between .vba and .vb files

> * No other discoveries today

## August 6th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

Today was a better day for me productivity wise. I got up and started my other tasks first thing when I got on my laptop (journaling, Khan Academy daily session) then I went outside and also visited before getting back to work.

I got a decent amount done today, and I resumed work on the personal audio collection project, after a 20 day hiatus. I now plan on developing 14 more versions of this (I am making 26 updates for starters, 1 update for 1 letter of the first letter of each playlist title, A-Z (special characters, such as Chinese and Cyrillic characters, have already been implemented as an extra) 

I went to get into Discord later today, and found that the debian file version I installed had an update, but the developers of Discord were too lazy to make auto-update functionality. I can't get from version 0.10 to 0.11 without reinstalling, and the functionality should have been included. Opening the debian file just redirects to the Ubuntu store page, which doesn't even have an "update" option. I ended up having to get a PTB version, but I didn't know enough about it, and also a Ubuntu snap version, just so I can use it until I can fix the issue with the debian version. I really hate snaps, due to them being proprietary and closed source, and not being able to install software offline, so this is always a last resort.

Today was generally a good day. I was able to get a lot more done when setting my main task to slot 0.3 of my daily tasks. (0.2.8 and below are waking up, setting things up, etc.) I was also able to reset my bedtime, but then end up staying up past midnight again.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing :(

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Bluetooth on Linux can connect to all devices, including phones. This is something I was unable to do on Windows 10. BlueTooth is going incredibly slow for me, I don't know if this is normal, but it is going at the speed of DSL Internet (86-96 kbps)(

> * Manuals on Linux can also be accessed in the terminal with the `man` command

> * No other Linux discoveries today

Today was another good day. I worked on my journaling and Khan Academy first thing after booting my laptop up and getting programs ready again today.

Today I made an important late discovery, which was that I can upload folders to GitHub. I discovered it by accident, and I would have liked to know this over 17120 commits ago, it would have been really helpful, as now, there isn't as much that I can upload with this method. There are some cons to it, such as empty folders not uploading, the same 100 file limit, the same 1000 file truncation rule, and the GitHub 25 Megabyte limit, but the 2 pros (folder upload, optional) somewhat outweigh the cons for me, which is weird, as it isn't normal for 4 cons to outweigh only 2 pros.

I continued work on the audio collection again today, releasing edition M (V0.0.13) with 13 more versions to go. I also got out of the house again today.

I wanted to do more, but my focus completely wore off past 5:45 pm, and I wasn't able to get back to work long term. I also plan on going to bed even earlier tonight, as I want to start waking up at 5:00 am or 6:00 am again. I like working when the moon is still out, darkness gives me lots of good memories and nostalgia.
 
I worked on my Gist offline, wrote some notes, and did 1 final Khan Academy archive today before shutting down.

I didn't upload a new version of the Gist today, I am holding it off for another day, maybe 2, 3, or however many it takes me to get to upload it again. It shouldn't take me longer than a week.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Folders/directories can be uploaded to GitHub as well as files, but with the usual limitations of uploading files

> * No other GitHub discoveries today

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * That a lot of packages that are installed aren't able to be run via an application, but through the terminal

> * The very basics of the Inkscape snap (For now, I am using snaps, as it is extremely difficult to compile a program that is distributed via tar.xz for me)

> * Linux has a swapfile, just like Windows (and probably other operating systems as well)

> * `-` is called a pipe (message me `pi-pe872020` and respond with a source if this is incorrect, as this is not yet certified information)

> * How to run neofetch

> * How much better Konsole is compared to the default GNOME terminal (not proprietary, and many more features)

> * That you can view a list of manuals by typing `man man` (manual manual) into the terminal

> * No other Linux discoveries today

I had a good day again today. I got over 12 hours of sleep last night, oversleeping by 2 hours. I got to work slightly later, but still got a lot done. I planned on working on the audio collection project again today, along with the microwave project, and some other projects, but I didn't have the time, as I started to lose functionaliy at 6:30 pm, and I had ran out of time for today, as I planned on going to bed early again tonight, preparing for bed from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm again.

Today, I worked solely on the Windows 10 Python Edition project, as it is something I could easily make tons of progress on with the new knowledge of the GitHub folder upload functionality. It has saved me over 7 hours of time so far. I also got close to completion of the project today, but I ran out of time.

Today, I got to get out of the house again, and I also re-configured 6 virtual machines, and learned several things about Linux. I decided to work on finalizing and uploading the Gist before quitting today. Today was a good day for development, but I could have done more.

As of today, I have officially had my new Linux based laptop for a month. As of tomorrow, I will be a full-time Linux user for a month.

Today was a difficult day for development. I woke up before 7:20 am today, but I didn't get to work on GitHub until after 4:00 pm. I got to work on other projects later, and mostly played games throughout the morning, playing Team Fortress 2 for about an hour, and Mari0 for over an hour. I also got out of the house today, and did some virtual machine tests, all virtual machine tests failed. I was trying to get another Windows XP virtual machine to work, but I couldn't get a functional product key, and I also couldn't get it to activate, as the VM had no INternet connection. I even tried the `0000 FF D5 71 D6 8B 6A 8D 6F D5 33 93 FD` registry trick, and that didn't even work. So I gave up on the project. I was trying to finalize my recreation of my laptop from 2009, I have all the files, but I couldn't get the machine to work.

Anyway, not much was done today. I came up with a cool new idea today, which is a link modifying program that modified the color of different parts of a hyperlink, but not the links itself. I got the concept down today, but I temporarily halted development, so I could finish other tasks.

I also finalized part 1 of the build18 upload for the Windows 10 Python Edition project, I hope to finalize it tomorrow. I also had to delay Gist updates, despite today being the 1 month anniversary of my Linux desktop (all my devices no longer use Windows, and use Linux, as of 1 month ago)

Today was an OK day for development.

What I learned on GitHub today:

I had a good day with development again today. I woke up a lot later today, and got to work a lot later. I needed some breaks at times. I did not get out of the house today (other than going outside once)

Today, I finalized work (for now) on the Windows 10 Python Edition project, and made a minor update to my Khan Academy archive. I try to update the archive every even number of days, this time it happened to be 4 instead of 2. I still haven't gotten to making a full time November 2018 archive update yet.

Work on the Windows 10 Python Edition project took up the majority of the work time. I plan on working on the Windows Server 2016 Python Edition project tomorrow, as it has a lot less to it than the previous project.

I have been dealing with a lot of tension today again as well. I had a good day with development today. I am still doing the early bedtime thing, I might reduce the time further, so that I can wake up even earlier. I didn't have the time to post a Gist update today, but I further prepared it today, splitting the new Resume section out.

Today was a difficult day for me with productivity. I keep waking up late, and I keep getting distracted. I just haven't been very motivated lately.

Today, I finalized work on the Windows Server 2016 Python Edition project (for now) and did some work in other projects, along with a Gist and separate Gist chapter update.

GitHub had a stupid UI change today, changing the colors for GitHub commit activity, so now my activity looks worse and less organized, and unpredictable. I took the time to get the previous designs pattern a while ago, now it is useless, so here it is:

GitHub commit activity July 30th 2020

0 = gray
1-154 = green1 
154-306 = green2
307-459 = green3
460-613 = green4

This no longer applies. I don't know why Microsoft makes horrible changes like this unannounced. They should at least document it better, as I am confused as to how the colors are applied, and why this change was even necessary.

I am going to bed early again tonight, I hope to get more done tomorrow. Today was an OK day for development.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * That the commit frequency colors were changed

> * No other GitHub discoveries on August 11th 2020.

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * That there is a command called `uptime` that does exactly what it says (displays the uptime)

> * No other Linux discoveries on August 11th 2020.

Today was a pretty difficult day for me. I had an unbearable amount of tension today, and I couldn't get that much done. I decided to take my last 2 hours and 44 minutes of development time off and play games instead, as I wouldn't be able to produce a quality update with all my tension.

I did some important things today, such as picking up on older projects, including LinkLax, and SNU Family Tree, where I wrote a homepage, wrote some scripts, and added a Wiki (both)

I am doing a lot better today, but I didn't get to work until later, as I was procrastinating up to 2:22 pm, before I started work on my other projects.

I finished my other projects after 4:00 pm, but then I got into another project. I did another virtual machine attempt today, this time not even bothering with Microsoft Windows. I went and had 3 attempts at a modern Android virtual machine. The 3rd attempt was successful, and I got a functional Android 9 virtual machine (The newest that Android-x86 provides, as I want app support for as long as possible in this VM) it was a huge project that took well over an hour.

Here is my documentation from it:

```

It was a lot of work. I found a working solution today, I did 2 installs before this but couldn't get into the setup process. This is the solution I used: https://youtu.be/137jBpJniNs with this machine, I got every app from my current phone on it, except for Plants vs. zombies 2, it wouldn't even let me install it, out of over 130 apps, this one was the only fault.

Some other weird things: some apps refuse to open. I don't know whether it is due to compatibility, or not enough RAM, I am hoping it is due to RAM. And finally, I gave the system 64 gigabytes of space, but when I checked the storage, it said it was using 128 gigabytes of space, and that the operating system was using 65 gigabytes of memory, which is 1 gigabyte more than the entire disk I gave it. I don't know how this error happened. I even double checked; VirtualBox reports a usage of 64 GiB on Disk, and my systems memory only went down 30 gigabytes after both virtual machines.

I am just really glad I got it working. If anyone else wants to try this as well, here are some other links:

VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/

Android x86 (not just 32 bit, it is just Android for non-Android devices) - https://www.android-x86.org/

The Android 9 image I used - https://osdn.net/projects/android-x86/downloads/71931/android-x86_64-9.0-r2.iso/

I am hoping this will eventually replace my phone.

```

I didn't get to GitHub work until nearly 6:00 pm. I didn't have time to get as much done, so I did what I could with the less than 2 hours of time I had. I am hoping tomorrow will go better; I feel like I have lost control of alot in the past 3 days, and I am going to have to work to correct this. I didn't have tension while working today luckily.

Today was an OK day for development.

Yesterday wasn't the best day for software development for me, but it was a really good day for research, as I have had a massive increase in technical research thanks to the difficulty of getting this VM to function properly; it has caused me to further branch off on my research, and do more research again.

Today wasn't the best day for research, but it was a good day for software development. I made it a commitment today to get more control over myself again, and get work done. I was able to successfully do that today, holding off all gameplay until after all work was done, and getting to work before 12:00 pm. However, I did have difficulty working due to some distractions, such as a lot of noise at our house.

I also got out of the house today, and took my laptop outside of the property for the first time. I discovered something weird about GNOME and the Wi-Fi icon, which I listed below.

Ever since I switched to Linux from Windows 10, I have had a massive decrease in technical complaints and issues, going down over 1400% with 0-2 issues a day, whereas on Windows 10, I would have 5 to 40+ issues a day. It is so much better.

The only issues I had with Linux today was a popup for network properties, which I don't care about that much, it is the 2nd time I have encountered this error. It is very minor, and it doesn't affect me. The only real issue I had today is a user issue, which is that I kept accidentally clicking the middle mouse button on my touchpad, causing multiple versions of windows and programs to open.

I plan on trying to disable the middle mouse button tomorrow, as it has been a bother to me ever since I switched to Linux. The only solution I am currently seeing is for a command line method, which I decided to hold off for tomorrow, as if there is an issue tonight, it wouldn't be as good as a day when I have more time. I would rather save the big problems for another day, so I don't worry about them all night, on top of my other thousands of worries.

Today was good for development. I worked on finalizing an update to the SNU 2D Programming Tools module; I thought it was going to be a tedious update, but it was actually enjoyable. I also published 2 new releases for the Windows 10 and WIndows Server 2016 Python Edition projects, and worked on a new update for my personal audio collection.

I hope to work on other things tomorrow. Today was the start of me repairing my schedule. Today was a good day for development.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing :(

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * That when you leave a Wi-Fi spot, the icon doesn't stay with a no Internet status for long. An error message will popup, and the Wi-Fi options will be hidden in a menu, instead of having a "no Internet" icon at the top

> * No other Linux discoveries today

I found out how to download entire playlists in the background with konsole + youtube-dl and I was able to add more than a full 1% to my giant music collection.

I got a little over 4 hours of sleep last night, I couldn't get back to sleep this morning. I thought this was going to completely ruin my day, as I normally have significantly amplified pain when I get less than 5 hours of sleep. However, today actually went incredibly well for me. I was able to finally get to use my laptop at 5:00 am, something I have been trying to achieve for months, I got to visit with my family frequently, I got to do 299 GitHub commits before 1:00 pm, and I was able to complete all my normal daily tasks, all with no pain or tension. 

I am going to have to get more sleep tonight, it shouldn't be hard now. I have always been able to function well with very little sleep, the only side effect that normally prevents me from functioning well is the severe overall body pains I get from it.

Today, I got a lot done, had time to relive my old childhood, watching the content I used to watch on my iPod back when I was in 4th grade, surprisingly, YouTube has kept a lot of it. 2005-2012 was an era on YouTube where people constantly uploaded and used copyright materials in their videos. Now it has turned to crap, as it began to get crappier and crappier due to the increasing limitations put on creators, especially with the denial of Fair use for all. Most things done in 2008 would get your channel taken down within hours before you could even do a half of a percent of what you could do in 2008. The problem now is YouTube is just a corporate platform, with a still decreasing focus on creators.

I rambled a bit, I was able to get a bunch of stick figure videos downloaded, in case the unthinkable were to happen soon. Today was a really good day for development by the way, in all categories (except for programming, I forgot to mention that last time)

I had a really good day with development today. I got nearly 12 hours of sleep last night, and made up for all missed sleep yesterday.

My commit quantity has been excessive lately, as I have been working heavily on my audio collection project. Today, I added over 90 new directories to the main views today, which took a very long time to do.

I plan on going to bed early again tonight, so instead of pushing past to the `2 music (projectless)/` directory for the S update, I quit for the night. I considered updating my Gist again and publishing the update, but I only updated it.

I haven't updated the commit count Gist in a while, I plan for the next update to happen once I surpass 20000 commits, which should be pretty soon. Today was a very good day for development.

I had another really productive day today. So last night, I went on Reddit and went to see how much Karma is required to create a community. I only had 72 karma (combined) yet it let me create a community. I will link to it elsewhere.

Today, I worked on the Subreddit for a long time, and also did lots of GitHub work, finalizing the S update for my personal audio database, and creating and finalizing the T update to the same project. These were the 2 most difficult updates to make so far, as it required an excessive amount of uploads, since there were over 70 directories per update.

I hope to finalize the project within the next 3 days, there are only 6 more updates to make until I am caught up. Work on this project has been my sole focus for a few days now, and I also focused on the subreddit today.

I am getting very close to 20000 commits on GitHub. Also about the Subreddit, there were so many customization options, I plan for my website (SNU) to have lots of customizaiton updates, similar to this. Kudos to the old Reddit design process (pre-2014)

I didn't publish the latest version of my Gist publically again today, I will try to submit the new version either after I reach 20000 commits, or after development dies down when I catch up on work with the AudioDB project. Today was another really good day for development.

I had a day with many distractions. I finally reached the 20000 commit milestone, but I didn't celebrate too much.

Earlier today, I was trying to put 23 videos into a playlist to see how much runtime there was, as the correct metadata wasn't showing up in the file properties. I went to open the 23 videos with VLC, but instead of just playing 1 video and leaving the other 22 in queue, it opened 23 instances and completely froze my computer. Time had stopped. I could still use my mouse, but I couldn't do anything. I was trying various keyboard combinations to either close the windows, or send the shutdown signal. After I plugged in my laptop, it became responsive and had the "you will be signed out in 1 minute" dialog. I closed out of it and tried to close more videos, then the screen went black and had its usal driver failures print to the screen for 1 second, then it shut down. I didn't lose any of my work, but I lost over 15 minutes of time dealing with an unresponsive system, and about 3 minutes to get everything up and running again.

Anyway, today I continued work on the audio collection, finalizing the U and V updates. I will be done pretty soon. I also started another project today that searches for and deletes unneeded `IGNORE.md` and `.gitignore` files.

I was very hyper and stressed out today, but I got a decent amount of work done. Today was an OK day for development.

## August 20th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I had a very good day with development today. I spent a few hours this morning and early in the afternoon working on catching up work on the audio database project. It took me 3 months to finish this project, and I am so happy that I finally got it done. It is easily one of my biggest accomplishments today.

During the first 3 hours of GitHub work today, GitHub was acting incredibly slow. I don't need to do a speedtest, as I have noticed that the GitHub processing speed is the same (its on their end) no matter if I have 70 kb/s to 4 mb/s Internet (last laptop on 2G Wi-Fi) or 460+ MB/s Internet (current laptop on 5G Wi-Fi) it started responding better later on. GitHub itself didn't report any issues or downtime. It was taking over 5 minutes to process a single file, slowing me down.

I am still really happy I finished the project today. I currently plan on 2 paths for tomorrow so far: a SNU Programming tools update, and work on my Khan Academy archive. I did some Khan Academy archive work later tonight to add diversity, I got to go outside for a bit as well and relax. I also got out of the house with my laptop a 2nd time today.

Just like I said, I got to updating my main Gist. I wanted to post an update to celebrate 20000 commits, but commit counts aren't as important as work on a long-term project, so it was better to celebrate the completion of a 3 month project. I will now only work on the Audio DB from time to time,

I have been also staying consistent on posting to my new subreddit. Today was a very good day for development.

GitHub slow

## August 21st 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value.

I had a good day with development today. I discovered a GitHub secret today, started following and starring more projects. I also got a lot done and worked on a total of 9 different repositories.

I got out of the house with my laptop for the 3rd time today. My Linux elitism in public finally slowed to a halt for now, and I just placed music the whole time for everyone. I focused deeply, and only picked the songs I thought would fit best, and it worked really well. I was able to pull off a highly successful first car radio.

Today, I worked on some of the projects I planned to develop, the only thing I didn't get to was homepages for SNU programming tools, and some Gist work. I have also decided to make the Audio database a project that is updated as frequently as the Khan Academy archive.

Today was a good day for development. I stayed up an hour later with work today, I felt like it. I hope my schedule doesn't fall downhill from here.

## August 22nd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands.

I started work a little later today. I went to bed later last night. I had to quit work early with a severe technical issue that went unfixed for the night, which was that the August 5th 2020 daily entry in the Gist caused a critical formatting error that ruined the other half of the document. As of AUgust 22nd 2020, I have fixed it. I found that the `<select>` tag line caused the entire issue. I came to a couple other conclusions last night when thinking on how to fix this, but I completely forgot about this.

Today, I did Gist development early, and made my edits more public, as I am now using my special repository (seanpm2001/seanpm2001) as a sandbox, and general purpose GitHub development center. So the entry so far is incomplete, I will add more later.

I had a huge revelation last night, and finally found my full potential. I have been criticizing myself for years, but I finally fixed my mindset and now know I am a good programmer. I have now rebuilt the bridge I burnt about not going to College, and I now intend to get a programming degree, earning some money, and founding my non-profit organization. I don't know all this is going to affect my GitHub activity.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * No other GitHub discoveries on August 22nd 2020

## Khan Academy

I am a regular user of Khan Academy, with 1162 consecutive days and counting. I normally watch 1 video a day and read the article succeeding it, but sometimes I watch multiple videos. I was originally introduced to Khan Academy in Middle School, and I got back into it as an extra task once I completed my Microsoft Office classes.

## My experience with Scratch

I started to learn programming in early 2015 (I currently don't remember whether it was January or February 2015) I started with the very basics, learning Scratch 2.0. I was a little bad at first, but once I got a few concepts, I picked up from there and became obsessed with it, then making over 1200 projects over the course of nearly 4 years. Some of these projects have great detail to them. I stopped using Scratch and moved on eventually, as there were limits, such as what I could do with it, the 360p resolution limit, and the 50 megabyte project limit. I am glad I quit when I did, as shortly after I quit, Scratch 3.0 was released, and it looks like a giant hot mess to me.

## YouTube and early times on social media

I got a FaceBook account in early 2015, but abandoned it pretty quickly. I then started a YouTube channel on May 14th 2015 under the name Sean Walla Walla. I uploaded random videos at the time, and over time, I began to get consistency. I uploaded mediocre videos at first, but at the peak of my time on YouTube, I uploaded mediocre videos as well. The mass uploading started in 2016, with the daily stat series, where I archived game process on 10 different games with a less than 1 minute 15 second video for each game daily. I also made a lot of my videos in different speed formats, some of these were successful. My YouTube career is something I do not look fondly back upon. It tore up my life in 2017 and 2018, the obsession caused me to set ridiculous wake up times and bedtimes, such as waking up from 6:00 am down to 2:50 am, and going to bed from 9:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I was trying to spread myself as well, and I left comments on many videos. I didn't entirely get edginess at the time, and looking back, I have a bunch of crappy comments. I think about them constantly every day. I spread to various platforms, including Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, and some others, but it ultimately ended in June of 2018 when I ran into an error that made over 400 images corrupted (as my video recorder began having severe problems) and I finally just gave up on it. Now I could focus on my programming career even more, and leave this behind me. However, I still plan on archiving my accounts, I just haven't found the time or resources, as there is an estimated 1+ terabytes of data, and right now, my laptop doesn't even get more than 4 MBPS connection speed, so that would never work, especially with Spectrum failing every single day (our Wi-Fi has been going out on a daily basis 1 to 4 times a day for nearly a week as of June 21st 2020)

## Virtualization

In the summer of 2018, I got into virtual machines. I originally started by trying to get 1 virtual machine to run, but I was really bad at it at the time. Within a day, I got Windows XP mode running, but it was really crummy due to how basic it was. So I had some help from [channa-my](https://gist.github.com/channa-my) who gave me one of his copies of Windows XP, along with a product key. Once I got this running, my interest in virtualization blew up, and I began to try and emulate as many operating systems as I could, including Linux, MacOS, Android, almost every version of Windows, and many attempts at iOS. I made over 200 virtual machines, then one day, they were all destroyed due to Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) so I lost over 240 Gigabytes of data. I have been trying to get back into Virtualization in 2020, as of June 20th 2020, I have 4 virtual machines, a Kubuntu 18.0.4.2 VM, a Fedora 31 workstation VM, a virtual machine that mimics a [Samsung Galaxy S2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II) (the only problem is that I was only able to find an Android 2.2 ISO and not a 2.3 ISO, plus it is recognized as an ASUS device, and might not have the same CPU specs as an S2) and another attempt at a Windows XP virtual machine, where it all started.

## Farming

I live on a ranch, and have many animals. We have over a dozen chickens, 2 cats, 4 dogs, 3 fish, 3 horses, and some goats. On May 25th 2020, one of our goats gave birth to 2 baby goats. It happened at 1:30 in the morning, and by the time someone went out there to check on them, they were already cleaned off. They have been really fun.

## Political

I am not willing to talk politics publically. Currently, politics are just 2 groups of people belittling each other, and it would be pointless to debate it online due to how toxic it currently is. I may talk about things that have been politicized, such as wearing a face mask, but that is just common sense, not politics.

## Archivist

I am a digital archivist. I try to preserve software in any way that I can, even if it is just a 2.9.88.7.63 (long version number, obscure version) of a program.

## Tech support

I offer free tech support at random for people who need it. Although I no longer use Windows 10 as a primary OS (As of July 10th 2020) I can still offer Windows technical support due to 14 years of experience. I also offer the tech support for Windows 10 where if desired, I will take all the time needed to fix a Windows 10 setup without doing a reset, as I avoided this as well, and I found it inconvenient. I also give out all the steps so that you can fix it on your own, even if it is just a restart. Please note, the first 3 times an issue is fixable with a restart, I won't charge anything, but if the same issue is encountered a fourth time within a 366 day period, I start charging $1.00 per fix (if I can't charge, then I won't help after this point)

My other tech support info was moved to a separate Gist on August 1st 2020. You can view more info [here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/e45eea830c60e340c6cb5344db215bf8#Tech-support).

## Gist Info

Gist version: `64 (Saturday, August 22nd 2020 at ??:?? pm)` - RC1 - August 22nd 2020 at 12:18 pm

File type: `markdown (*.md)`

Character count (UNIX (LF) / Macintosh (CR)): 156,570 characters/bytes (156.57 Kilobytes)

Character count (WIndows (CR) (LF)): 160,601 characters/bytes (160.60 Kilobytes)

Word count: 0,027,473

Note (July 27th 2020) since I have been editing this Gist offline due to its massive size, I decided that I should do my classic character count method. I also added a word count counter

Note (July 31st 2020) I have moved 2 articles out of the main Gist and into separate Gists, now known as chapters. I had to do this after concerns about the file size and length of the main Gist. 2 major problems being the Gist was getting close to the size where it wouldn't be previewable anymore, or may have reached a limit on GistHub. This change has reduced the size by over 230 kilobytes, and I intend to nove more articles, especially all articles with subsections.

Line count (including blank lines and compiler line): `004,073`
