## Miscellaneous following

3. [hlwojiv](https://github.com/hlwojiv) - I randomly stumbled across this user, and from them, I learned how to unlock the GitHub profile secret
4. [Frances McCabe](https://github.com/fgmccabe) - The creator of the Go programming language, which was steamrolled over by Google with their Go! programming language, the day that their quote "Don't be evil" was repealed permanently

## Past and current GitHub followers slash stargazers that I am following

2 Past and current GitHub followers/stargazers listed

1. [Struow](https://github.com/Struow) - My first star on GitHub came from Struow. They took the star away, and I don't know why. I hope my response to his/her question on my repository didn't come off as angry, he didn't give any reason to unstarring. He/She starred my MCPYE project/
2. [Protamandua](https://github.com/Protamandua) - My second star on GitHub came from Protamandua, the user is from China. They starred my WacOS project
3. No other past/current GitHub followers/stargazers that I follow are listed

## To support GitHub

1 high level GitHub account listed

1. [Satya Nadella](https://github.com/satyanadella) - Followed so I could support GitHub, and also because he might be my future boss if I do end up working at Microsoft
2. No other accounts listed

***This section was last updated on August 22nd 2020 (08.22.2020)***

## Technical legends

2 computing legends listed

1. [Ken Thompson](https://github.com/ken) - Because he was a co-creator of the original UNIX system, Multics, and the C programming language, alongside Dennis Ritchie, who I find equally as important. Unfortunately, Dennis died 9 years ago, and hardly anyone ever talks about him, even though his work shows up everywhere
2. [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds) - Because Linus created one of the most major free and open source operating system projects of all time.
3. No other technical legends have been found on GitHub.
