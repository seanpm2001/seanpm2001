{{Windows XP}}
'''Windows XP''' is<!--Do ''not'' change to "was". This violates [[MOS:TENSE]], which specifies that all articles on operating systems are written in present tense, even if discontinued.--> an [[operating system]] produced by [[Microsoft]] as part of the [[Windows NT]] family of operating systems. It was the successor to both [[Windows 2000]] for professional users and [[Windows Me]] for home users. It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and broadly released for retail sale on October 25, 2001.

Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s as "[[Windows Neptune|Neptune]]", an operating system (OS) built on the [[Architecture of Windows NT#Kernel|Windows NT kernel]] which was intended specifically for mainstream consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000 was also originally planned for the business market; however, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed "Whistler", which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets. As such, Windows XP was the first consumer edition of Windows not to be based on [[MS-DOS]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-10-things-you-must-know-about-win-xp/ | title=The 10 top things you MUST know about Win XP | publisher=[[CNET Networks]] | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=October 25, 2001 | accessdate=July 22, 2008 | first=David | last=Coursey | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055856/http://www.zdnet.com/article/top-10-things-you-must-know-about-win-xp/ | archivedate=December 8, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, with critics noting increased performance and stability (especially in comparison to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia capabilities. However, some industry reviewers were concerned by the new licensing model and [[Microsoft Product Activation|product activation system]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lake|first=Matt|title=Windows XP|url=http://home.cnet.com/software/0-6688749-8-7007240-2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011119231138/http://home.cnet.com/software/0-6688749-8-7007240-2.html |archivedate=November 19, 2001|accessdate=May 29, 2014|newspaper=CNET Review|date=September 3, 2001}}</ref>

Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8, 2014, after which the operating system [[End-of-life (product)|ceased receiving further support or security updates]] (with exceptional security updates being made e.g. in 2019, to address potential [[ransomware]] threats, like [[BlueKeep]]) to most users. By August 2019, Microsoft (and others) had ended support for games on Windows XP. {{As of|2020|08|df=}},<!-- If you change this "As of" month, don't forget to also update the gs.statcounter.com url below. --> 0.8% of Windows PCs <!--Windows desktop--> run Windows XP,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201802-202006|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide {{!}} StatCounter Global Stats|last=|first=|date=|website=gs.statcounter.com|publisher=Statcounter|language=en|access-date=August 1, 2020}}</ref> and 0.3% of all devices across all platforms run Windows XP. <!-- 0.002997 calculated from 36.55% of Windows share of all devices x fraction of them running Windows XP, 0.82%.--> At least a few countries have double-digit use, e.g. [[Armenia]], where it's being replaced by [[Windows 10]], with both operating systems having over 40% use.<ref name="Armenia"/>

== Development ==
{{Main|Development of Windows XP}}

In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products: "[[Windows Odyssey|Odyssey]]", which was reportedly intended to succeed the future [[Windows 2000]]; and "[[Microsoft Neptune|Neptune]]", which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the [[Windows NT]] architecture, succeeding the [[MS-DOS]]-based [[Windows 98]].<ref name="cnet-consolidate">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-consolidates-Windows-development-efforts/2100-1040_3-236021.html | title=Microsoft consolidates Windows development efforts | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201144705/http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-consolidates-Windows-development-efforts/2100-1040_3-236021.html | archivedate=February 1, 2014 | df=mdy-all |date=January 24, 2000|first1=Stephanie|last1=Miles}}</ref>

However, the projects proved to be [[Development hell|too ambitious]]. In January 2000, shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer [[Paul Thurrott]] reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed "Whistler", after [[Whistler, British Columbia]], as many Microsoft employees skied at the [[Whistler-Blackcomb]] ski resort.<ref name=":0">{{cite web | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp | title=Windows "Longhorn" FAQ | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | date=June 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 4, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404091719/http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp | archivedate=April 4, 2008 | df=mdy-all | author=<!--N/A--> }}</ref> The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform: Thurrott stated that Neptune had become "a black hole when all the features that were cut from Windows Me were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project".<ref name="supersite-roadtoxp">{{cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-the-development-of-windows-xp-reviewed | title=The Road to Gold: The development of Windows XP Reviewed | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202144509/http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-the-development-of-windows-xp-reviewed | archivedate=February 2, 2014 | df=mdy-all |date=October 6, 2010|first1=Paul|last1=Thurrott}}</ref>

At [[Professional Developers Conference|PDC]] on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also unveiled the first preview build, 2250. The build notably introduced an early version of Windows XP's visual styles system.<ref name="witpro-betabegins">{{cite web | url=https://www.itprotoday.com/windows-server/introducing-whistler-preview-build-2250 | title=Introducing the Whistler Preview, Build 2250 | publisher=Penton Media | work=Windows IT Pro | accessdate=June 9, 2018 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142613/http://www.itprotoday.com/windows-server/introducing-whistler-preview-build-2250 | archivedate=June 12, 2018 | df=mdy-all |first1=Paul|last1=Thurrott|date=July 17, 2000}}</ref>

Microsoft released the first beta build of Whistler, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. Subsequent builds gradually introduced features that users of the release version of Windows XP would recognize, such as [[Internet Explorer 6.0]], the [[Microsoft Product Activation]] system and the ''[[Bliss (image)|Bliss]]'' desktop background.<ref name="supersite-roadtoxp2">{{cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-part-two | title=The Road to Gold (Part Two) | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202144533/http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-part-two | archivedate=February 2, 2014 | df=mdy-all |date=October 6, 2010|first1=Paul|last1=Thurrott}}</ref>

Whistler was officially unveiled during a media event on February 5, 2001, under the name Windows XP, where XP stands for "eXPerience".<ref name="cnet-xpnamed">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-to-christen-Windows%2C-Office-with-new-name/2009-1001_3-252047.html | title=Microsoft to christen Windows, Office with new name | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201144708/http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-to-christen-Windows%2C-Office-with-new-name/2009-1001_3-252047.html | archivedate=February 1, 2014 | df=mdy-all |date=February 5, 2001|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref>

=== Release ===
In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to, in conjunction with [[Intel]] and other PC makers, spend at least 1 billion US dollars on marketing and promoting Windows XP.<ref name="cnet-marketing1bn">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-269032.html | title=Windows XP marketing tab to hit $1 billion | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201144711/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-269032.html | archivedate=February 1, 2014 | df=mdy-all |date=January 2, 2002|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref> The theme of the campaign, "Yes You Can", was designed to emphasize the platform's overall capabilities. Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan "Prepare to Fly", but it was replaced because of sensitivity issues in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="Change-XP-slogan">{{cite web |url=https://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/511861/microsoft_changes_xp_slogan_wake_us_attacks/ |title=Microsoft changes XP slogan in wake of US attacks |work=Computerworld NZ |publisher=IDG |accessdate=August 7, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905135939/http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/511861/microsoft_changes_xp_slogan_wake_us_attacks/ |archivedate=September 5, 2015}}</ref>

On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was [[Release to manufacturing|released to manufacturing]] (RTM). During a ceremonial media event at [[Microsoft Redmond Campus]], copies of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC manufacturers in [[briefcase]]s, who then flew off on decorated [[helicopter]]s. While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general, retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, "Home" and "Professional".<ref name="supersite-roadtoxp3">{{cite web |url=http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-part-three | title=The Road to Gold (Part Three) | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows | accessdate=March 11, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829035957/http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-part-three |archive-date=August 29, 2017 | url-status=dead|date=October 15, 2001|first1=Paul|last1=Thurrott}}</ref>

== New and updated features ==
{{Main|Features new to Windows XP}}

=== User interface ===
[[File:RoyaleXP2.PNG|thumb|Updated start menu in the Royale theme, now featuring two columns]]

While retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP's interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an increased use of [[alpha compositing]] effects, [[drop shadow]]s, and "[[Windows XP visual styles|visual styles]]", which completely changed the appearance of the operating system. The number of effects enabled are determined by the operating system based on the computer's processing power, and can be enabled or disabled on a case-by-case basis. XP also added [[ClearType]], a new [[subpixel rendering]] system designed to improve the appearance of fonts on [[liquid-crystal display]]s.<ref name="Microsoft Corporation">{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306527|title=HOW TO: Use ClearType to Enhance Screen Fonts in Windows XP|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=October 27, 2002|work=Support|accessdate=August 8, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805145836/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306527|archivedate=August 5, 2011|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref> A new set of system icons was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb986055.aspx|title=New Graphical Interface: Enhance Your Programs with New Windows XP Shell Features|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=November 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809204642/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb986055.aspx|archivedate=August 9, 2011|first1=Dino|last1=Esposito}}</ref> The default wallpaper, ''[[Bliss (image)|Bliss]]'', is a photo of a landscape in the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] outside [[Napa, California]], with rolling green hills and a blue sky with [[stratocumulus cloud|stratocumulus]] and [[cirrus cloud]]s.<ref name="bliss1">{{cite news |url=http://spokesmanreview.com/pf.asp?date=022204&ID=s1490284 |title=No view of Palouse from Windows |first=Paul |last=Turner |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane |date=February 22, 2004 |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511110350/http://spokesmanreview.com/pf.asp?date=022204&ID=s1490284 |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Start menu received its first major overhaul in XP, switching to a two-column layout with the ability to list, pin, and display frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and the traditional cascading "All Programs" menu. The [[taskbar]] can now group windows opened by a single application into one taskbar button, with a [[popup menu]] listing the individual windows. The notification area also hides "inactive" icons by default. A "common tasks" list was added, and [[Windows Explorer]]'s sidebar was updated to use a new task-based design with lists of common actions; the tasks displayed are contextually relevant to the type of content in a folder (e.g. a folder with music displays offers to play all the files in the folder, or burn them to a CD).<ref name="sacred">{{cite news|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Jason|title=The Start Menu Should Be Sacred (But It's Still a Disaster in Windows 10)|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/|accessdate=July 30, 2016|work=How-To Geek|date=August 6, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313114850/https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/|archivedate=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Fast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP machine without existing users having to close their programs and logging out. Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e. monitor, keyboard and mouse), previous users can resume their session once they regain control of the console.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/kb/279765|title=How To Use the Fast User Switching Feature in Windows XP (Revision 1.5)|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=March 27, 2007|work=Microsoft Support|accessdate=August 8, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812020916/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/279765|archivedate=August 12, 2011|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref>

A [[copy protection]] system known as [[Windows Product Activation]] was introduced with Windows XP and its server counterpart, [[Windows Server 2003]]. All Windows licenses must be tied to a unique ID generated using information from the [[computer hardware]], transmitted either via the internet or a telephone hotline. If Windows is not activated within 30 days of installation, the OS will cease to function until it is activated. Windows also periodically verifies the hardware to check for changes. If significant hardware changes are detected, the activation is voided, and Windows must be re-activated.<ref name="ars-activation">{{cite web|title=Windows Product Activation: an early look|url=https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2001/02/wpa.ars|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=February 22, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205075258/http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2001/02/wpa.ars|archivedate=December 5, 2011|date=February 2, 2001|first1=Ken|last1=Fisher}}</ref>

=== Networking and internet functionality ===
Windows XP was originally bundled with [[Internet Explorer 6]], [[Outlook Express]] 6, [[Windows Messenger]], and [[MSN Explorer]]. New networking features were also added, including Internet Connection Firewall, [[Internet Connection Sharing]] integration with UPnP, NAT traversal APIs, Quality of Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling, [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service]], extended fax features, network bridging, peer to peer networking, support for most [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] modems, [[IEEE 802.11]] ([[Wi-Fi]]) connections with [[Wireless Zero Configuration|auto configuration]] and roaming, [[Telephony Application Programming Interface|TAPI 3.1]], and networking over FireWire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457047.aspx|title=Windows XP Networking Features and Enhancements|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|work=[[Microsoft TechNet]]|date=August 8, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172203/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457047.aspx|archivedate=July 26, 2011|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref> [[Windows Remote Assistance|Remote Assistance]] and [[Remote Desktop Services|Remote Desktop]] were also added, which allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the [[Internet]] and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or request help.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Remote Desktop |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/rdfaq.mspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704104713/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/rdfaq.mspx |archivedate=July 4, 2007 |date=<!--N/A-->|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref> Improvements were also made to ''IntelliMirror'' features such as [[Offline Files]], [[Roaming user profiles]] and [[Folder redirection]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Otey |first1=Michael |title=Discover Windows XP |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954392.aspx |publisher=Microsoft Developer |accessdate=June 21, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420161139/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954392.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2012 |date=October 2001}}</ref>

Some of the programs and features that were part of the previous versions of Windows did not make it to Windows XP.

== Editions ==
{{Main|Windows XP editions}}

[[File:XP-Editions.svg|thumb|280px|Diagram representing the main editions of Windows XP. It is based on the category of the edition (grey) and codebase (black arrow).]]

Windows XP was released in two major editions on launch: ''Home Edition'' and ''Professional Edition''. Both editions were made available at retail as pre-loaded software on new computers and as boxed copies. Boxed copies were sold as "Upgrade" or "Full" licenses; the "Upgrade" versions were slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of Windows to install. The "Full" version can be installed on systems without an operating system or existing version of Windows.<ref name=cnet-marketing1bn/> The two editions of XP were aimed at different markets: ''Home Edition'' is explicitly intended for consumer use and disables or removes certain advanced and enterprise-oriented features present on ''Professional'', such as the ability to join a [[Windows domain]], [[Internet Information Services]], and [[Multilingual User Interface]]. Windows 98 or Me can be upgraded to either version, but [[Windows NT 4.0]] and Windows 2000 can only be upgraded to ''Professional''.<ref name=technet-differences>{{cite web|title=Differences with Windows XP Home Edition|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457127.aspx|work=TechNet|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=January 26, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209183913/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457127.aspx|archivedate=February 9, 2014|date=September 11, 2009|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref> Windows' [[software license agreement]] for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be "returned" to the OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110706-dell-windows.html | title=Dell customer gets Windows refund | publisher=IDG | work=LinuxWorld | date=November 6, 2006 | accessdate=September 13, 2008 | first=Don | last=Marti | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927111046/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110706-dell-windows.html | archivedate=September 27, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Despite the refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.citebite.com/s2u3d5wajak|title=HP must reimburse Italian PC buyer the amount paid for Microsoft software|publisher=Heise online|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015203020/http://pages.citebite.com/s2u3d5wajak|archivedate=October 15, 2008|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref>

Two specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain types of hardware, exclusively through [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] channels as pre-loaded software. ''[[Windows XP Media Center Edition]]'' was initially designed for high-end [[home theater PC]]s with [[TV tuner]]s (marketed under the term "Media Center PC"), offering expanded multimedia functionality, an [[electronic program guide]], and [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) support through the [[Windows Media Center]] application.<ref name="cnet-xpmceannounce">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-reveals-media-XP-details/2100-1016_3-944063.html | title=Microsoft reveals media XP details | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 26, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207142141/http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-reveals-media-XP-details/2100-1016_3-944063.html | archivedate=February 7, 2015 | df=mdy-all |first1=Joe|last1=Wilcox|date=July 16, 2002}}</ref> Microsoft also unveiled ''[[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]]'', which contains additional [[Stylus (computing)|pen input]] features, and is optimized for mobile devices meeting its [[Microsoft Tablet PC|Tablet PC]] specifications.<ref name="cnet-tabletpcdrive">{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-launches-tablet-PC-drive/2100-1005_3-964903.html | title=Microsoft launches tablet PC drive | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 26, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207141635/http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-launches-tablet-PC-drive/2100-1005_3-964903.html | archivedate=February 7, 2015 | df=mdy-all |date=November 7, 2002|first1=Joe|last1=Wilcox|first2=Sandeep|last2=Junnarkar}}</ref> Two different [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] editions of XP were made available; the first, ''Windows XP 64-Bit Edition'', was intended for [[IA-64]] ([[Itanium]]) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on workstations in favor of [[AMD]]'s [[x86-64]] architecture (which was supported by the later ''Windows XP Professional x64 Edition''), the Itanium version was discontinued in 2005.<ref name=computerworld-xpitaniumdiscontinued>{{cite web|title=Microsoft nixes Windows XP for Itanium|url=https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/98716/Microsoft_nixes_Windows_XP_for_Itanium?taxonomyId=125|work=Computerworld|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|accessdate=January 26, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202171023/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/98716/Microsoft_nixes_Windows_XP_for_Itanium?taxonomyId=125|archivedate=February 2, 2014|date=January 5, 2005|first1=Joris|last1=Evers}}</ref>

Microsoft also targeted [[emerging market]]s with the 2004 introduction of ''[[Windows XP Starter Edition]]'', a special variant of ''Home Edition'' intended for low-cost PCs. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer owners, containing heavy [[Software localization|localization]] (including wallpapers and screen savers incorporating images of local landmarks), and a "My Support" area which contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also removes certain "complex" features, and does not allow users to run more than three applications at a time. After a pilot program in [[India]] and [[Thailand]], ''Starter'' was released in other emerging markets throughout 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-xp/windows-xp-starter-edition|title=Windows XP Starter Edition|first=Paul|last=Thurrott|date=January 3, 2005|accessdate=April 12, 2008|work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows|publisher=[[Penton Media]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828180310/http://winsupersite.com/windows-xp/windows-xp-starter-edition|archivedate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> In 2006, Microsoft also unveiled the [[Microsoft FlexGo|FlexGo]] initiative, which would also target emerging markets with [[Subsidy|subsidized]] PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.<ref name=cnet-payasyougo>{{cite web|title=Microsoft pitches pay-as-you-go PCs|url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-pitches-pay-as-you-go-PCs/2100-1003_3-6074589.html|work=CNET|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=January 26, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207143018/http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-pitches-pay-as-you-go-PCs/2100-1003_3-6074589.html|archivedate=February 7, 2015|date=May 23, 2006|first1=Ina|last1=Fried}}</ref>

As the result of [[unfair competition]] lawsuits in [[Europe]] and [[South Korea]], which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status in the PC market to favor its own bundled software, Microsoft was ordered to release special versions of XP in these markets that excluded certain applications. In March 2004, after the [[European Commission]] [[European Union Microsoft competition case|fined]] Microsoft €497 million (US$603 million), Microsoft was ordered to release "N" versions of XP that excluded Windows Media Player, encouraging users to pick and download their own [[Media player (application software)|media player]] software.<ref name="WinXPSBBC">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4388349.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Microsoft and EU reach agreement|date=March 28, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922061907/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4388349.stm|archivedate=September 22, 2015|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref>  As it was sold at the same price as the version with Windows Media Player included, certain OEMs (such as [[Dell]], who offered it for a short period, along with [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Lenovo]] and [[Fujitsu Siemens Computers|Fujitsu Siemens]]) chose not to offer it.

=== Service Pack 1 ===
Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB 2.0 support, the [[Microsoft Java Virtual Machine]], [[.NET Framework]] support, and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming ''Media Center'' and ''Tablet PC'' editions of XP.<ref name=pcmag-xpsp1>{{cite web|title=Windows XP SP1 Irons out the Wrinkles|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,526004,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=January 26, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226221844/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,526004,00.asp|archivedate=February 26, 2014}}</ref> The most significant change on SP1 was the addition of ''Set Program Access and Defaults'', a settings page which allows programs to be set as default for certain types of activities (such as media players or web browsers) and for access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player) to be disabled. This feature was added to comply with the settlement of ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v.

The security improvements (codenamed "Springboard",<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.itprotoday.com/windows-8/windows-xp-sp2-be-springboard-longhorn|title=Windows XP SP2 to be 'Springboard' to Longhorn|journal=[[Windows IT Pro]]|first1=Paul |last1=Thurrott|date=October 15, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623230427/http://www.itprotoday.com/windows-8/windows-xp-sp2-be-springboard-longhorn|archivedate=June 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> as these features were intended to underpin additional changes in [[Windows Longhorn|Longhorn]]), included a major revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall, and now enabled by default), and an update to [[Data Execution Prevention]], which gained hardware support in the [[NX bit]] that can stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks. [[Raw socket]] support is removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by [[Zombie computer|zombie machines]]) and the [[Windows Messenger service]] (which had been abused to cause pop-up advertisements to be displayed as system messages without a web browser or any additional software) became disabled by default. Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added [[Security Center]], an interface which provides a general overview of the system's security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates. Third-party firewall and [[antivirus software]] can also be monitored from Security Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/overview.mspx|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|title=Windows XP Service Pack 2 information|date=August 4, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016045833/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/overview.mspx|archivedate=October 16, 2007|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref>

The unique boot screens that identified the edition of Windows XP currently running, including a green progress bar for Home Edition and a blue progress bar for other editions, were removed and replaced with a generic "Windows XP" boot screen with a blue progress bar with this service pack.

In August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (SP2b), in order to incorporate a patch requiring [[ActiveX]] controls in Internet Explorer to be manually activated before a user may interact with them.

=== End of support ===
On April 14, 2009, Windows XP exited mainstream support and entered the extended support phase; Microsoft continued to provide security updates every month for Windows XP, however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes were no longer being offered.

In January 2014, it was estimated that more than 95% of the 3 million [[automated teller machine]]s in the world were still running Windows XP (which largely replaced [[IBM]]'s [[OS/2]] as the predominant operating system on ATMs); ATMs have an average lifecycle of between seven and ten years, but some have had lifecycles as long as 15. Plans were being made by several ATM vendors and their customers to migrate to Windows 7-based systems over the course of 2014, while vendors have also considered the possibility of using Linux-based platforms in the future to give them more flexibility for support lifecycles, and the [[ATMIA|ATM Industry Association (ATMIA)]] has since endorsed [[Windows 10]] as a further replacement.<ref name=atmia-w10>{{Cite press|url=https://www.atmia.com/news/atmia-position-paper-recommending-migration-to-windows-10/2607/|title=ATMIA position paper recommending migration to Windows 10|publisher=ATM Industry Association|date=June 1, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045048/https://www.atmia.com/news/atmia-position-paper-recommending-migration-to-windows-10/2607/|archivedate=May 25, 2017|author=ATM Industry Association (collectively)|website=www.atmia.com|language=en}}</ref> However, ATMs typically run the embedded variant of Windows XP, which was supported through January 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/atms-face-deadline-to-upgrade-from-windows-xp | title=ATMs Face Deadline to Upgrade From Windows XP | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | date=January 16, 2014 | accessdate=January 17, 2014 | first=Nick | last=Summers | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116190619/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/atms-face-deadline-to-upgrade-from-windows-xp | archivedate=January 16, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of May 2017, around 60% of the 220,000 ATMs in India still run Windows XP.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wannacry ransomware cyber attack: Indian ATMs could be at high risk as most run on Windows XP|url=http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/wannacry-ransomware-cyber-attack-indian-atms-high-risk-windows-xp/story/252161.html|website=Business Today|accessdate=May 18, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517085703/http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/wannacry-ransomware-cyber-attack-indian-atms-high-risk-windows-xp/story/252161.html|archivedate=May 17, 2017|date=May 15, 2017|author=<!--N/A-->}}</ref>

Furthermore, at least 49% of all computers in [[China]] still ran XP at the beginning of 2014.

While Microsoft did not comply with their requests, a number of major Chinese software developers, such as Lenovo, [[Kingsoft]] and [[Tencent]], will provide free support and resources for Chinese users migrating from XP.<ref>{{cite web |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-microsoft-partners-lenovo-tencent-to-offer-xp-tech-support-in-china/1889658.html |title=Microsoft Partners Lenovo, Tencent to Offer XP Tech Support in China |publisher=Voanews.com |date=April 9, 2014 |accessdate=April 16, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124242/http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-microsoft-partners-lenovo-tencent-to-offer-xp-tech-support-in-china/1889658.html |archivedate=April 13, 2014 }}</ref> Several governments, in particular those of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, elected to negotiate "Custom Support" plans with Microsoft for their continued, internal use of Windows XP; the British government's deal lasted for a year, and also covered support for [[Office 2003]] (which reached end-of-life the same day) and cost [[Pound sterling|£]]5.5 million.<ref name="ars-notdeadyet">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/not-dead-yet-dutch-british-governments-pay-to-keep-windows-xp-alive/|title=Not dead yet: Dutch, British governments pay to keep Windows XP alive|last1=Gallagher|first1=Sean|date=April 6, 2014|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast|Condé Nast Publications]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014235635/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/not-dead-yet-dutch-british-governments-pay-to-keep-windows-xp-alive/|archivedate=October 14, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019}}</ref>

Despite the approaching end of support, there were still notable holdouts that had not migrated past XP; many users elected to remain on XP because of the poor reception of [[Windows Vista]], sales of newer PCs with newer versions of Windows declined because of the [[Great Recession]] and the effects of Vista, and deployments of new versions of Windows in enterprise environments require a large amount of planning, which includes testing applications for compatibility (especially those that are dependent on Internet Explorer 6, which is not compatible with newer versions of Windows).<ref name=bbc-xpwontdie>{{cite web|title=XP – the operating system that will not die|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26432473|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 25, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324064133/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26432473|archivedate=March 24, 2014|date=March 5, 2014|first1=Mark|last1=Ward}}</ref> Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of [[Google Chrome]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] web browsers;<ref name=cw-dumpie/> despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform.<ref name=pcadvisor-xpsecure>{{cite web|title=What should XP users do when Microsoft ends support?

Similarly, specialized devices that run XP, particularly [[medical device]]s, must have any revisions to their software—even security updates for the underlying operating system—approved by relevant regulators before they can be released. For this reason, manufacturers often did not allow any updates to devices' operating systems, leaving them open to security exploits and malware.<ref name=mitreview-medicalviruses>{{cite web|title=Computer Viruses Are "Rampant" on Medical Devices in Hospitals|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/news/429616/computer-viruses-are-rampant-on-medical-devices-in-hospitals/|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=April 6, 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20161019024034/https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429616/computer-viruses-are-rampant-on-medical-devices-in-hospitals/|archivedate=October 19, 2016|url-status=live|date=October 17, 2012|first1=David|last1=Talbot}}</ref>

== Reception ==
On release, Windows XP received critical acclaim. [[CNET]] described the operating system as being "worth the hype", considering the new interface to be "spiffier" and more intuitive than previous versions, but feeling that it may "annoy" experienced users with its "hand-holding". XP's expanded multimedia support and CD burning functionality were also noted, along with its streamlined networking tools. The performance improvements of XP in comparison to 2000 and Me were also praised, along with its increased number of built-in device drivers in comparison to 2000. The software compatibility tools were also praised, although it was noted that some programs, particularly older MS-DOS software, may not work correctly on XP because of its differing architecture. They panned Windows XP's new licensing model and product activation system, considering it to be a "slightly annoying roadblock", but acknowledged Microsoft's intent for the changes.<ref name=cnet-xpreview>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Windows XP – Home Edition review|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/microsoft-windows-xp-home-edition/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531181049/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3672_7-5020549-2.html|archivedate=May 31, 2007|work=CNET|accessdate=March 25, 2014|date=October 10, 2002|first1=Matt|last1=Lake}}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' provided similar praise, although noting that a number of its online features were designed to promote Microsoft-owned services, and that aside from quicker boot times, XP's overall performance showed little difference over Windows 2000.<ref name=pcmag-xpreview>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Ships Its Biggest OS Upgrade Ever—Early!|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,5772,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=March 25, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325083348/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,5772,00.asp|archivedate=March 25, 2014|date=September 3, 2001|first1=Edward|last1=Mendelson |author-link1=Edward Mendelson}}</ref> Windows XP's default theme, Luna, was criticized by some users for its childish look.<ref name="Manes2004">{{cite web|title=Full Disclosure: Your Take on Windows' Worst Irritations|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/117427/full_disclosure_your_take_on_windows_worst_irritations.html|date=2004-08-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008081626/http://www.pcworld.com/article/117427/full_disclosure_your_take_on_windows_worst_irritations.html|archivedate=2009-10-08|last=Manes|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Manes|work=[[PCWorld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]}}</ref><ref name="Bright2014">{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/memory-lane-before-everyone-loved-windows-xp-they-hated-it/|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=2014-04-10|last=Bright|first=Peter|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424071600/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/memory-lane-before-everyone-loved-windows-xp-they-hated-it/|title=Memory lane: Before everyone loved Windows XP, they hated it|archivedate=2014-04-24|accessdate=2014-06-20}}</ref>

Despite extended support for Windows XP ending in 2014, many users – including some enterprises – were reluctant to move away from an operating system they viewed as a stable known quantity despite the many security and functionality improvements in subsequent releases of Windows. Windows XP's longevity was viewed as testament to its stability and Microsoft's successful attempts to keep it up to date, but also as an indictment of its direct successor's [[Criticism of Windows Vista|perceived failings]].<ref name="ArsTenYearsXP">{{cite web |title=Ten years of Windows XP: how longevity became a curse |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/10/ten-years-of-windows-xp-how-longevity-became-a-curse/ |website=Ars Technica |publisher=WIRED Media Group |accessdate=June 9, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142054/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/10/ten-years-of-windows-xp-how-longevity-became-a-curse/ |archivedate=June 12, 2018 |date=October 25, 2011|first1=Peter|last1=Bright}}</ref>
