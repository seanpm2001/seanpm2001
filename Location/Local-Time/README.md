# Local time

I have been observing the `local time` feature on other GitHub users account for about a month. Before I updated my social links on 2023, February 3rd, I was unsure how you got it on your profile. It shows users how far away their time zone is from yours.

It was incredibly easy, more people should know how to do this, the GitHub profile "secret" isn't as secret as this.

My timezone is: `(GMT-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)`

This was enabled on 2023, February 3rd.
