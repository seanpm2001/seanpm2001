## GitHub social interactions

### Follow for follow

By default, I follow anyone who follows me. A link to your profile is created in a GitHub follow log for the day I followed you. I don't always get to it immediately, it takes me a maximum of 3 days to do so.

I started doing follow for follow in my first year of GitHub usage. As of 2022, Thursday, May 26th, I have no plans to stop.
