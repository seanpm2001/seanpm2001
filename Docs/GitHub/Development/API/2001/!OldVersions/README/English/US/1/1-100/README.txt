### API 2001

I follow a development style that changes over time. I currently refer to it as an API, and based on recent changes, the API level increases once or twice every month.

I keep a history of API changes. You can view them here: [`https://github.com/seanpm2001/API-2001/`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/API-2001/)
